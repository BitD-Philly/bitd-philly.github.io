# Appearance
Sizzle is a young woman of a slight, wiry build. She has steely grey eyes with a steady, focused gaze. Her curly blonde hair is long enough to brush her elbows when let loose, but more often than not is pulled back in a braid to keep it contained. Her clothes, well-worn but equally well-cared for, are cut in a style more reminiscent of the Imperial City than Duskvol. In addition, she wears a deep red cloak that can be pulled up to obscure the lower half of her face.

Two revolvers hang from her belt, the butt of their handles pointed forward. The guns themselves have a distinct copper sheen to them and are always freshly polished. The same leather used for the holsters has also been worked into bracers and close-fitting spaulders that provide a resting place for her hawk, Velvet.

## Velvet

Velvet is a harrier hawk with rust-colored, white-spotted feathers covering her body and long black and grey wing feathers. She has yellow-rimmed red eyes and a black, hooked beak.
