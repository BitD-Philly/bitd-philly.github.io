This is a character wiki page! Write a short summary about your character here at the top of the page. Below are some additional (suggested!) sections.

You can link to other wiki pages like this:`[link text](link-target)`, where `link text` is the text that is written on the page and `link-target` is the name of the page you are linking to.

**Note that valid links are lowercase and spaces must be replaced with dashes (-).**

Examples:
* [Duskvol](duskvol)
* The [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower-consortium)

You can also link to sub-headers on any page by using a # after the `link-text`. For example, linking to Cruncho's backstory would look like this:

`Due to Cruncho's [personal history](cruncho#backstory) with football, he was able to...`

# Appearance
Describe your character's appearance here.

# Background
Describe the character's background and any known significant life events.

# In Duskvol
Describe interactions during game events, citing sources as needed. [^my-footnote]

**Note:** _Do not cite the wiki as a primary source!_ Acceptable sources include blog posts (e.g., session recaps), messages from the BitD Philly Discord (#fluff_and_nonsense, roleplay threads), dates of gameplay, and private communications with the DM. 

# Affiliations
Create lists using asterisks:

* Friend 1
