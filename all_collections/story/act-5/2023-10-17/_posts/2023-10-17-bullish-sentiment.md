A Message to the Shareholders of Seventh Tower Consortium, from Chairperson `Ä̷̡̌Ì̷̝̂Ä̵̖̍Ì̶̹̍È̷͎̽Ì̷͙̀Ä̸̯́Ì̶̻̅È̵̝͠Ì̵̟̀Ä̶̺͂`:

> Greetings, esteemed board members!

> As we at the Consortium look forward to a successful Q4 of 847, I'd like to take a moment to "shout out" our incredible Duskwall street team for the work they've been doing to shift the paradigm of Six Towers and deliver shareholder value at rates well above our expected ROI. Q3 has not been without its challenges, but I feel confident that recent developments point to bright futures ahead for our investments.

> In our efforts to make the dream of Seven Towers a reality, we have partnered with a well-respected small enterprise (colloquially, the "Bill-hooks") to expand our efforts and provide a little "on-the-ground" know-how to our operation. With their assistance, we have secured valuable dockside real estate on top of our own considerable inroads with housing acquisition within Six Towers. I can also now reveal that we have secured rights to the exciting "X8" and "Puerto Rico Strauss" brands, which will soon be synonymous with hedonism, sophistication, and heterosexuality. "Va-va-voom!"

> Thanks to the continued work of our fine partners at BlackOak Securities, we have succeeded in ensuring that our holdings will be protected from certain Nameless (ha-ha!) threats to our interests in Six Towers. This includes the acquisition and distribution of literal tons of military-grade weaponry and armor, which will be used to defend our properties and development roadmaps with overwhelming force. While certain Nameless (ha-ha!) inconveniences have caused the loss of some of those shipments, and while the recent Skovlan and vampiric uprisings have caused turmoil within Duskwall, rest assured that our holdings remain untouched thanks to the diligent work of our street team and partners.

> We have also partnered with several fantastic contractors to ensure the removal of certain "inconveniences", which will synergistically be used to ensure that certain Nameless (ha-ha!) problems are removed or occupied with legal entanglements. This includes Myleria Klev (Iruvian diplomat and alleged gang leader) and Eckherd Deckherd ("noble"), ensuring that our Nameless (ha-ha!) problems will be without recourse when Phase II of our development roadmap is put into practice (UPDATE: I regret to inform you that contractor inefficiencies have failed to secure the removal of the Klev inconvenience or Nameless legal implication in the death of Eckherd Deckherd. These inefficiencies will be aggressively rectified by in-house staff).

> As we enter Q4, we begin our full-fledged war on the Nameless (ha-ha!) issues that stand to slow our growth in key sectors. While the waters may be choppy, the S.S. Seventh Tower Consortium is a mighty frigate crewed by seasoned sailors. As its proud captain, I assure you that we are unsinkable, regardless of the Nameless (ha-ha) Leviathans that would capsize us. Little do they know, they will be the electroplasm that lights our lamps and propels us to a brighter tomorrow! Huzzah!

> Yours respectfully,
