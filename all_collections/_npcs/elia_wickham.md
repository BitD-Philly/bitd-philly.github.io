# Appearance
Elia primarily appears to the group in the form of Old Wickham, a hunched, collossal woman with sharp teeth who dresses in large furs, or as Young Wickham, a plucky yet sinister street lad. She is able to change the appearance of her spirit form quite easily, and writes pieces of herself into those she interacts with. Currently, a fraction of her being is etched into the essence of [Orianna](affect), [Cruncho](cruncho), and possibly [Linmer](linmer).

# Background
Elia is a remnant of the pre-cataclysm world, but it is unclear how much of those bygone days she remembers. She was a shadow witch either fighting for or against the [Cinder King](the-immortal-emperor), but due to some sorcerous accident she outgrew the bounds of what shadow magic should be able to do, and became capable of self-replicating her spirit by consuming others'. 

# In Duskvol
The Nameless first encountered Elia in the [Lost District](..locations/the_lost_district) where she offered to help them outpace their pursuers in the hazardous terrain in exchange for being let into the city of Duskvol. Desperate to survive their attackers, the group agreed and allowed her passage into the city, hwere she then fled to [Makeout Mine](..locations/makeout_mine). [^my-footnote]

# Affiliations

* [Orianna](affect) has sworn to destroy Elia-- the witch taunts her about this when they interact. 
* [Linmer](linmer) has some sort of relationship to young hamwick, but hasn't disclosed the nature of that relationship.
* [Cruncho](cruncho) has taken a piece of Elia willingly into the "geistcore."
* [Scurlock](lord-scurlock) has some sort of relationship with Elia, though the Nameless do not know how they regard each other.
