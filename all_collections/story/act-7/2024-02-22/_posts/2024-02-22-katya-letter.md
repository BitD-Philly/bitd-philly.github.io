With the events of DuskViolence... well, not complete, but as close as they can be, Dr. Yekaterina Volkova retreats to her room. Not her chambers in the Nameless hideout, but her apartment in Charterhall. Knowing there's no one there who will cast her a sidelong look for the trademark bruises around her throat or scratches on her arms -- apart from her cat, Sonya, who will judge her under any circumstances -- she does not bother to hide either. Instead, she sits at her desk, pulls out a sheet of paper, and begins to write a letter.

> To the Honorable Dr. Anastrasya Dmitriyevna Fedotova --

> I hope this correspondence finds you well and that you are enjoying retirement. I am pleased to report that my experience at Charterhall University has been positive thus far, and that I have even received a promotion to Chair of the Social Sciences department. I also trust you know all these things already, and that you know me well enough to know that this is not a social call.

> I am approaching now the age that you were when you began to look for an apprentice. Or, as you so described, a successor. I myself have recently come into the supervision of an academically gifted young woman, whose name I would prefer not to write should this message be intercepted. Instead, I trust you to trust my judgment when I say she is quite capable.

> I worry about this woman's family and the trouble that they might bring to her door. Though up until this point she has concerned herself solely with academic matters, both her parents and her brother have a habit not only of making problems, but pushing these problems onto others.

> Put simply: I want her to be able to defend herself against whatever threats may soon enter her life. While both of us are capable combatants, you are far more a teacher than I, and I humbly request your assistance -- not as a student, or as a scion, but as now a peer -- in carrying on the lessons passed down from you to me. I'm under no delusions that you will be able to meet in person, although I do miss your company. Whatever wisdom you wish to share is acceptable by my standards.

> Please respond at your earliest convenience.

> Yours truly,   
Dr. Yekaterina Nikolayevna Volkova
