Chuck picked at the burns along the side of his body with methodical precision, shedding cauterized skin and unpleasant humours as he went. The process had been a nervous tic when they'd first dug themselves out of the Palisades, but as time had gone on, the habit had taken on an air of solemnity.

***"So, how'd ya like yer first taste of vigilante justice?"***

*"Ehhh . . ."* he hummed, squinting across the square to the growing number of crosses that the Black Knights were erecting, *"I mean, this seems a little too much, ya know?"*

***"C'maaaahn, Charlie! We're partners! If we ain't got honesty, what do we got?"***

*"Okay fine! Fine! I don't know if I like it! Getting that Morgan kid was real useful and all, but his dad was fun! Like, he was just out there goin' nuts on people, poopin' his pants and sayin' crazy shit! That was great! So why'd he have ta die, huh?"*

***"Well, I mean, Charlie, I can do that too! So could you, if you wanted to! Nobody's stoppin' either of us from shittin' our pants, goin' nuts, and talking all crazy!"***

*"Yeah but that's not the point, Frank! Neither one of us could do it like Clelland could! 'slike if we killed Veldren just cuz we can take drugs and see a frog and Jesus too! We can't do it like HE does it!"*

~~Elia Wickhamm~~ Frank Reynolds paused for a moment, briefly stumped. This instance had only existed for a month, but it had all the memories that the core Elia Wickhamm had possessed at the time of his instantiation, and this was the first convincing argument he'd ever heard for preserving a human life.

***". . . Well how do we know if we don't try?"*** he ultimately rejoined, aware of the weakness of his rebuttal.

Chuck didn't respond to this immediately. In his heart of hearts (which ~~Elia Wickhamm~~ Frank was starting to be able to discern), he felt that self-defecation and lunacy at Clelland's level required a combination of natural aptitude and a lifetime of experience that neither of them truly possessed. 

*"Ehhhh don't worry about it. Let's talk cerebro-spinal fluid. You get what you need when I snooted it?"*

***"Oh you bet! Lotsa good stuff in there. Didja know that the evidence locker at the Docks has the biggest collection of ceramic figurines in all o' Duskwall? You could eat for a month on that stuff! Then there's-"***

*"The NAMELESS, Frank! Stuff about the Nameless!"*

***"Oh! Well, uh . . ."*** stammered ~~Elia~~ Frank, twisting their strange gremlinoid body in parody of self-consciousness, ***"I, uh, haven't gotten ta that part yet. Where they bought him out, I mean."***

*"God DAMN it Frank, why the hell not? Did I snoot that goop for nothin'?"*

***"Nononono, you snooted it real good Charlie, it's just . . . Well, Clelland did a lotta fun stuff in his off time, and I ain't never heard of some of it, and I wanted to take a little looky-loo, ya know?"***

Chuck made to yell at ~~Elia~~ Frank, but paused. A thoughtful expression stole across his face as he picked further at his arm.

*". . . What kinda stuff?"* he asked, eventually. He didn't seem to notice the traces of membranous black fluid that was goopily gathering within the recesses of his ruined skin. 

~~Elia~~ Frank did, though. He was extremely excited at the prospect, in fact. A fully mature Crow was generally beyond his ability to possess, but a maturing Crow . . . yes, that appeared be a different matter entirely!

***"Oh, it's crazy! Ya ever heard of potato-shrimping? I'll get the memory for ya, it's reaaaaal weird . . ."***
