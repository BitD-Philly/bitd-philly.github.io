*The Namelesss are called upon by Irag, the flayed Black Knight who serves as general to Render. His mission is simple.*

**"I am told you broke Seventh Tower in Duskwall. I seek the man Joseph Woodward, and any assassins he might have employed. I would find the tinkerers that built his blasphemous weapons, which were used to slay the Chosen of the Immortal Emperor. I would have them brought before me. I would know how they learned to make these weapons, and how far the knowledge has spread."**
