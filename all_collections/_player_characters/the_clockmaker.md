**Note that valid links are lowercase and spaces must be replaced with dashes (-).**

Examples:
* [Duskvol](duskvol)
* The [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower-consortium)

You can also link to sub-headers on any page by using a # after the `link-text`. For example, linking to Cruncho's backstory would look like this:
