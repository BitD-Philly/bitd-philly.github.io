# Session Recap

To exonerate [Katya](/wiki/katya) from her potential loss of position and to distance the gang from culpability in the Duskvol Ironworks explosion, [Arkin](/wiki/arkin) pretended to go after the President of Charterhall University so that Katya could "kill" him. Arcade and Katya emerged as heroes of the hour, and Arkin implied that he was solely responsible for the Ironworks explosion before being "slain".

The group also discovered that University President [Vinculus Swing](/wiki/npcs#vinculus-swing) AND University trustee [Arthur Pendryn](/wiki/npcs#lord-pendryn) are part of a secretive Cult to Vazara (a centuries-forgotten sky goddess). Upon informing Scurlock of this fact, the vampire reacted with cold rage and a desire to exact bloody revenge. Scurlock and Lugos went off to permanently deal with this cult and their members. Scurlock did not return, and the cult remains active. Lugos DID return with significant damage, and has refused to communicate what happened.
