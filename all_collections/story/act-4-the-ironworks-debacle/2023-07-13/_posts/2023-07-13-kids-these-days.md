The woman sets down her quill and turns to face Elia Wickhamm. The latter is still in her cherubic youngster guise, and is sitting insouciantly on the ceiling.

***"Not that it isn't . . . refreshing . . . to see you, Elia-"***

*"Oi! Me nayme's Youngge Hamwick, so 'tis! An' Oi aiyn't t' reploi t' no uvvah nayme, Miss Breaker!"*

The woman sighs deeply. An irritation centuries old can be detected therein.

***". . . Young . . . Hamwick . . . you're really married to that?"***

Elia nods vigorously from her perch. After a moment of disgruntled calculus, the woman ("Miss Breaker", or Breaker if you're a thousand years old) decides to let it go.

***"Fine. Why are you here? And why have these brigands steal Scurlock's lockbox?"***

Elia springs from the ceiling and lands feet-first on the floor.

*"Well, it's loike this, Miss Breaker! See, Oi 'eard that ol' Scurly aiyn't around no more, an' Oi ALSO 'eard that yer Ladyship's enterprise needs annovah Eidolon! So 'ere Oi am, to offer me services!"*

Breaker leans back in her chair and looks speculatively at Elia, who is digging her heel into the wooden plank in a pantomime of bashfulness.

***"Did you have anything to do with Scurlock's disappearance?" she ultimately asks through narrowed eyes.***

Elia shakes her head with her entire body. In the shadows, a bit of metal glints in sparse candlelight.

***"Very well. You shall help me complete this labor for the Emperor. Lugos, ensure that Young Hamwick remains equal to our work."***

With that, Lugos is upon Elia, who barely avoids a half-dozen stilettos that nearly plant themselves into her neck.

*"PISS AN' BLIMEY!"* she crows, dancing away from the robot's whirling blades and making a hasty retreat deeper into the apartment.

As Lugos springs after Elia, Breaker consumes the paper and begins to levitate.
