Usually found at the fighting pits or getting into some sort of easily avoidable trouble, Jammer is 50% muscle and 50% bad decisions. Or 100% muscle and 100% bad decisions. Very useful in a fight, though.

# Appearance
Stupid fauxhawk, leather jacket, and a lot of dumb tattoos. 

* Left arm: the crest of the Dagger Isles Marines Expeditionary Force on the bicep, a tight, precise script that looks like contractual language curling around the underarm down to the elbow, and a stylized lobster cracking a harpoon in half between its claws on the forearm. 
* Right arm: a full sleeve scene of leviathan swallowing a tall ship that sprawls from the bicep down to the forearm, a large uppercase script CASTA that has been corrected to CASTAWAY nestled on the underarm, and a small oval portrait of an angelic looking man with brown skin and flowing dark hair clutching a dildo in his hands wrapped with the words JESUS FUCKS on the inside forearm.

# Story
## Backstory
What kind of person comes to Duskvol for a bit of vacation? Someone who started off in the Dagger Isles marines, then spent a while bouncing between security work on merchant vessels and stints on leviathan hunting ships, and finally decided it was time for shore leave. But money runs out and a girl gets bored, sooo...
