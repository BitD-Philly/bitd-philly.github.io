The Nameless's next job was given to them by [Lady Claddage](/wiki/npcs#lady-claddage), wife of private banker (and alleged embezzler) [Lord Claddage](/wiki/npcs#lord-claddage). The lady had decided that the social fallout of her husbands crimes was too extensive for her to wish to remain married to him, and so asked the Nameless to help her fake her own death. 

Upon arrival at [Claddage Manor](/wiki/six-towers#claddage-manor), the Nameless quickly found themselves in a bespoke house of horrors, as the entire mission was revealed to be pretext for a deranged [Cassiopeia Beasby](npcs#cassiopeia-beasby) to take bloody revenge upon those who had wronged her. The Nameless slew Beasby and just barely escaped with their lives.
