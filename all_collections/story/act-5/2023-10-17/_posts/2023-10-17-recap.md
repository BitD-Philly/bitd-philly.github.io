Seventh Tower Consortium is gentrifying Six Towers out from under you   
There are Imperial weapons involved   
And a spooky man in a hat   
Roselyn of the Dimmer Sisters is dead, but you’ve framed it on Seventh Tower Consortium!


Grace the assassin is here to:
1. Kill Eckherd Deckherd
2. Kill Myleria Klev of the Red Sashes
3. Frame someone (the Nameless) for both of these deaths.
4. Cause a brief lightning wall failure to the west

Realizing that she has overextended herself (it happens in this capitalist grindset society!), she has contacted her friend Sizzle and her divinely(?)-ordained ally Cruncho to help her out with these two jobs!

Eckherd is dead and framed in a way that will NEVER STICK IN COURT

the Crows and Black Knights are IN the city!

Valanthe has a date with Sizzle over firearms

Render is 6-8 weeks away

The Nameless are at War with Seventh Tower Consortium and sort of also the Billhooks!

The Red Sash’s leader survived an assassination attempt through an untraceable anonymous tip so you’re going into this shit with your allies intact!
