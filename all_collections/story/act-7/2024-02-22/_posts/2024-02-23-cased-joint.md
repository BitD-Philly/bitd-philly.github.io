Veldren is in his Thinking Spot, doing his Thinking Pose. To his left and right, Bonkey Bill and Jesus stare, enraptured, as the master works.

**". . . they stole the boat,"** he proclaims, at last

*"'Aye, 'tis so, 'tis so,"* replies Bonkey Bill, sans his customary throne of clouds. Though he is frog royalty, he often eschews his throne while in the Thinking Spot. He is no king here.

**"And in stealing the boat, they deprived poor Arlene Dunleavy of her sole means of financial support . . ."**

***"Condemning an impoverished widow to drudgery and woe! They shan't see my father's kingdom, dash it all, not if I have any say in the matter!"*** proclaims the Son of Man, puffing up his chest and waving his cane as though daring anyone to object.

**". . . and in doing so, permitted our former paramour to meet her . . . CURRENT partner . . ."**

*"And we wish her the best, of course."*

***"We wish them BOTH the best."***

**"Yes, of course. That she took our finest psychadelia and burned our dwelling with her damnable pottery phase-"**

*"Feh! Pots! Never once!"*

***"No pot-heads shall see my father's kingdom, dash it all, not if I have anything to say in the matter!"***

**"-shall, of course, have no factor in the rigor of our vengeance."**

*"Of course not."*

***"Not at ALL."***

**"Nor, of course, shall the sundry arrests that have been occasioned by our interactions with the Nameless-"**

*"Of COURSE not."*

***"Not at ALL."***

**"NO, friends! We do this for PROPER vengeance! For Winslow, felled by poor drug creation and Spirit Warden plotting. For Arlene, toiling as a deckhand while our ex-paramour's NEW partner lives on HER steamboat!"**

*"Aye!"*

***"No squatting surgeons shall see my father's kingdom, dash it all, not if I have anything to say in the matter!"***

**"And for poor Arkin, taken past the brink of sanity and murdered by CRUEL ACADEMIA! Arkin, who once we thought a traitor but now know to be a martyr. Arkin, who SHALL see your father's kingdom, Jesus!"**

***"He shall, if I have anything to say in the matter!"***

**"Then friends, no more dillying! No more dallying! The time has come, the time is now! We strike, for Arlene! We strike, for Winslow! We strike, for Arkin!"**

*"Hear hear!"*

***"HEAR HEAR!"***

"Here you go sir!" chirps the bright-eyed cashier, "One Leviathan, mushroom and Imperial Hag, crisped."

Veldren exits his thinking pose and takes the sandwich. Behind him, a line of hungry Levy's customers give a collective prayer of thanks as the psychonaut leaves the restaurant.
