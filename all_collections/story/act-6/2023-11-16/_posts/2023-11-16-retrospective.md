The Man with the Hat steeples his fingers, crouching over the large stone block as though it were a conference table. His guests do not comply with the fiction.

***"I believe that every failure is a learning opportunity,"*** he begins with steely cheer, casting his eyes around the motley assemblage, ***"But to LEARN, we must first identify our failures! So, I would ask each of us in turn . . . What HAPPENED last night? Boris?"***

Boris sighs from his perch, casting a wary eye over his fellows. When he speaks, his tone is carefully neutral.

"On my end? Too much shit going on. You threw drugs AND my box AND sparkcraft at this party, but you left it in charge of Strauss and Spud and expected them to play nice. Too many places for things to go wrong. Of course the Nameless were gonna take advantage."

**"Oh shit, THAT was the Nameless?"** exclaims Sam around an enormous mouthful of some unspecified crustacean, **"Damn okay, that makes things interesting-"**

***"Fair enough! THANK you, Boris. That's very helpful!"*** (Boris grunts with perfect neutrality) ***"Even in their weakened state, it is ABSOLUTELY fair to assume that the Nameless might try something! Which is why I asked YOU, esteemed Black Knights of the Immortal Emperor, to provide some security! But instead, you-."***

An arrow is abruptly through the Man in the Hat's chest. Sam stands up lazily, shouldering her bow.

**"Lemme make somethin' reaaaal clear, sweetie,"** she beams, **"We ain't your employees. We don't work for you. We're here for somethin' waaaay more important than your little real-estate fuck-dickery-"**

***"KAH! I . . . UNDERSTAND, but-"***

<span style="font-size: 1.5em">**"DO NOT. INTERRUPT ME. LITTLE MAN."**</span>

There is a beat of silence. After a moment, Sam continues.

**"So! You ask us for somethin'? We'll do it! If we feel like it. You want some party security? We'll do it! IF we feel like it. But if somethin' shows up an' makes us feel different? Then we'll do WHAT we feel like. Make sense?"**

The Man in the Hat pauses for a moment, and then nods. Satisfied, Sam sits down. A slight hissing echo from a nearby Dimmer Sister might possibly be a derisive chuckle.

***"Fair enough, madam. Might I therefore RESPECTFULLY inquire as to WHO you were fighting and WHY they convinced you to half-destroy Deckherd Hall?"***

**"You sure can!"** Sam beams. After a moment of silence, the Man in the Hat moves on.

***"Regardless . . . This new agent of the Nameless, this 'Spider' . . . I think we can all agree that her involvement, AND the as-yet-unexplained Crow exodus, AND the continued persistence of the Nameless in Six Towers means that they are a more formidable force than we might have assumed?"***

Nobody replies, but the Man in the Hat plows forward.

***"And I'm SURE we can all agree that their continued defiance of the Seventh Tower Consortium AND the duly-blessed agents of our beloved Immortal Emperor represent a kind of blasphemy beyond the usual activities of the criminal element?"***

Boris remains neutral, but Sam perks up at this.

***"AND let us not forget the death of poor Roslyn, doubtless at their savage hands, even as they were busy blowing up scores of loyal Imperial veterans!"*** the Man in the Hat continues, gesturing in a conciliatory way towards the nearby Dimmer Sister (and, indirectly, their temple in the background).

A hiss emerges from the Dimmer Sister, or the temple behind her. The Man in the Hat nods, having interpreted it one way. Boris purses his lips. Sam smirks. Both had caught the Sisters' true meaning. 

***"SO! I rather think it's our collective duty as loyal subjects of the Empire to scorch them from the face of Akaros! Blunt, brutal force, and damn the expenses! Strike bold and true, as the Immortal Emperor did against the foul gods of yore! With the might of the Black Knights, the magicks of the Dimmer Sisters, and the money of the Seventh Tower Consortium, these blaspheming impeding INFURIATING SNAKES will bedevil the good people of the Empire NO FURTHER!"***

Nodding companionably at the other two approximate-humans in the room, the Man in the Hat vanishes. Boris rises and begins to leave, and then stops.

"So, when all this is done," he drawls, turning back to Sam, "Would you mind if I feed him to my box? For Roslyn, and for the Sisters."

Sam examines him through narrowed eyes, and then beams again.

**"Sure! If we feel like it!"**
