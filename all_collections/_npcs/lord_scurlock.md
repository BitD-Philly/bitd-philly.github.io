A dangerous vampire with powerful connections. Ancient and immutable.

# Appearance
As a vampire, Scurlock's appearance depends on the body he is currently possessing. When the Nameless first met him, he was a dark, handsome man of noble descent; he has also appeared as [Lord Strangford](npcs#lord-strangford),[^the-shmeet-up] and as an old woman during the events of *DuskViolence II: Super Omega MAX Ultra Supreme Vortex*.[^valentines-sea-wrestling]

# Background
It is unclear what role Scurlock played in the time of the calamity or when he became a vampire, but the Scurlock family is said to have become part of Duskvol's early settlements hundreds of years ago. Their family manor still stands in [Six Towers](six-towers).

# In Duskvol

With [Casta](npcs#casta)'s assistance, Scurlock would leave his former body behind and possess the body of recently slain [Lord Strangford](npcs#lord-strangford), causing panic in the Nameless who had been involved in his murder.[^the-shmeet-up] In this body he would continue to infiltrate high governance and direct the Nameless from the shadows until an unfortunate encounter with the [Cult of Vazara](factions#cult-of-vazara), which resulted in his banishment.[^the-madmans-assault] Casta hired the Nameless to retrieve Scurlock's soul from the [Dimmer Sisters](factions#dimmer-sisters).[^thrice-again] Shortly after, Scurlock and Casta ambushed [Breaker](npcs#setarra) (inadvertently at the same time as the Nameless).[^broken]

After Breaker's death, Scurlock went in hiding and was not seen until DuskViolence II, during which he attempted to steal [Boris Volkov](npcs#boris-volkov)'s box but ultimately ended up inside of it instead.[^valentine-sea-wrestling]
