Professor Katya Volkova ate shit in front of a bunch of factory workers after being engaged in semi-aerial combat with the demonic foreman Slane JUST before the factory exploded.

Investigations are ongoing, but certain members of the university are eyeing her new position as department chair and trying to shuffle her off. Her case is not helped by the fact that three grad students trashed the social sciences library while hopped to the gills on Bloodneedle, and SOMEONE seems to have connected them to her.

Can a disgraced professor and a not-yet-but-maybe disgraced professor dodge university disciplinary proceedings and, perhaps, head off a criminal investigation???
