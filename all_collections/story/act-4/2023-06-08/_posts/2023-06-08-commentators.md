*Elsewhere, far away from Duskvol (but not so far as you'd think)*

**". . . the eidolon? And Lugos? I saw . . ."**

Gasping, wheezing sounds.

**". . . never mind. Rest. Tell me later . . ."**

The wheezing continues, but a second voice speaks up.

**". . . Mashed him . . . like a . . . potato . . ."**

In the pitch-darkness, three exhausted voices start laughing.
