**CW: Body horror, reference to sexual impropriety**

Dr. Carver Wrackham Malleus, PhD, IFD, opened the book with trembling hands. It looked like a children's book at first glance: paper cutouts and simple images over whimsical font . . . and yet, of the assembled concerned letters, solicitor's notices, and increasingly angry correspondences from granting agencies, this was the only piece of mail that mattered to him.

The . . . thing . . . below his beltline stirred as he read, a croaking staccato chattering underlying every printed word.

*If it's in a scheme or it's in a trick*  
*You can't get rid of the Babadick.*  
*If you're really a nasty one, and you know what it is to take*  
*Then you can be joined with a special one, a friend to cads and rakes*  

*His name is Mister Babadick, and this is his schtick.*

*A trouser shift, and three sharp pangs*  
*Ba-Ba-Ba Dick Dick Dick*  
*That's when you'll know that he's around, you'll feel him there (you prick)*  
*This is where he goes beneath your clothes, all up within your bits*  
*Feel him when you've some lusty thoughts and you'll just stop (you shit).*  

*He'll soon begin his REAL work, take heed of what you've read*  
*And once you see what's underneath*  
*You're going*  
*To wish*  
*You were dead*

*I'll wager with you. I'll make you a bet.*  
*The worse your thoughts, the stronger he'll get.*  
*You start to change when he gets in*  
*The Babadick growing right under your skin*

*Oh come, come see what's in your briefs!*

Watching from the window outside, Casta the bounty hunter took a moment to congratulate herself for taking that poetry class on a whim six years ago.
