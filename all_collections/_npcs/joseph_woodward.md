# Appearance
A well-dressed man who appears to be in his early forties. He is rarely seen without one of his signature black, wide-brimmed hats, which were specially created for him in the Imperial City and shipped to Duskvol in bulk.[^dishonored-guests]

# Background

About two decades prior to the founding of the Nameless, Joseph Woodward and his wive, Robin "Bo" Woodward, were living in a small community in the Deathlands surrounding the Imperial City. He left the homestead for unknown reasons around the same time as the birth of their [first child](sizzle).

Joseph arrived in Duskvol as the CEO the [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower) to spearhead the opening of the Duskvol branch. The details of how Joseph joined the Seventh Tower and his rise to executive leadership are currently unknown. 

Prior to the events of [The Crash](/story/act-6/2024-01-11/index.html), "Joseph Woodward" was a cocktail of a few different phenomena. He is 1 part the man who was [Sizzle](sizzle)'s father, 1 part ghost field binding agent (probably related to the arcane documents found in his Deckherd Hall office[^snakes-frame]), and about 4 parts of... something else. It's assumed that the "Seventh Tower Consortium" was filling up those 4 parts, but the exact nature of what that is would require more research.[^sizzle-clock]

However, what's clear is that Joseph Woodward willingly hollowed himself out to put most (not all) of who he was into [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower). This would've given it a blueprint for a kind of sentience that we'd recognize, as well as keeping Joseph Woodward alive and well as long as Seventh Tower was alive and well. It's not even as though Joseph would've felt much by the sacrifice: as long as he maintained an official and arcane connection to Seventh Tower, he'd be able to keep access to most (not all) of his conception of self AND gain a ton of social and supernatural power in the bargain. Essentially, he found his own blank-slate warlock patron and taught it to be about 80% exactly like him.[^sizzle-clock]

# Involvement with the Nameless

Woodward's connection to the ghost field was severed at the grand opening of the Palisade Avenue Stock Exchange.[^the-crash] Ordinarily, that effect would be of brief inconvenience, as a spirit would be inexorably drawn to its own still-living body. In Joseph's case, that spirit had been so adulterated by Seventh Tower Consortium that rejoining the two would have taken time or extreme arcane effort. Now that he's been fully ousted as CEO and had the door shut behind him by The Nameless's forgery, there's very little left of him; it's not clear that he's capable of being more than a hollow shell of a person anymore.[^sizzle-clock] 

Woodward is currently in Sizzle's custody.[^snakes-frame]
