There appears to be a new focus in how Seventh Tower is approaching things now. The loss of such an overwhelming chunk of their forces seems to have pushed them back towards more guerilla tactics. Small groups of operatives, moving to disrupt at all available avenues to the Nameless' cash flow and power base.

There are the expected attack avenues:

The Fog Hounds are facing shoot-to-kill orders from Seventh Tower to the Billhooks, and Captain Clelland is getting some increasingly appealing financial offers.

But also, something unexpected: scores of the seemingly-unending streams of Marines, as well as some Billhooks and other local muscle for hire, are marching down into the sewers of Six Towers, perhaps to speak to the Dimmer Sisters . . .
