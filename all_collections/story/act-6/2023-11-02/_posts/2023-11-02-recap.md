V-Sea-W has several dozen ex-Imperial Soldiers in V-Sea-W, turning away wrestlers and getting ready for war. 
There’s some kind of ghostly . . . Thing . . . Around the electroplasmic infrastructure of Six Towers in a 3-block radius of V-Sea-W.

The Billhooks were approached by 7th Tower because they are less entrenched in Six Towers and a more feasible option. The Billhooks sold you out for cold hard cash.

The Gang Fakes a Loss of V-Sea-W. Bodies are planted, and the wrestlers are on board but they’re gonna wanna unionize after. V-Sea-W has been classified as a historical landmark

Construction materials have been sabotaged for Seventh Tower Consortium   

Duskwall has Batman now, and they’re attacking V-Sea-W. The clockmaker is aiding Batman (the Spider). The ghost of Francois is also involved.

7th Tower has lost over a dozen experienced soldiers in “taking” (not really) V-Sea-W. “The Spider” is a new black-garbed and caped vigilante with impossible fighting skills and several gadgets at her disposal. She appears to be allied with the Clockmaker and the Ghost of Francois. She does not appear to be explicitly targeting the Nameless YET. OH and the Spider has a sample of Mara’s blood. But that’s probably fine.

Katya, Linmer, Mara, Orianna, and Sandro are all presumed dead. Arkin was, of course, ALREADY presumed dead.
