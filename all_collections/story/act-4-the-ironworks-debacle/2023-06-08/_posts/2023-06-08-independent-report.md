**TW: Fictitious account of a school shooting.**

*Taken from the headlines of the Duskvol Independent:*

> # UNIVERSITY ASSAULT IMPLICATES DISGRACED PROFESSOR IN IRONWORKS SABOTAGE
> ## Unstable Ex-Instructor Slain By Chair of Social Sciences Department

> Arkin Wollenstonecraft, ex-professor of Sparkcraft and Biology at Charterhall University, died in an attempted assault upon University Grounds this morning.

> The former academic, armed with explosives and firearms, engaged in a highly destructive rampage upon the campus. Witnesses say Wollenstonecraft was yelling several imprecations against the University and President Vinculus Swing, seemingly grievances related to his termination last year.

> Wollenstonecraft also alleged his involvement and responsibility in the Duskvol Ironworks explosion. An anonymous source in the City Watch confirms that Wollenstonecraft's involvement is being investigated, and that there is evidence to corroborate his claims.

> The highly destructive rampage resulted in no fatalities, but crucial components of the Sparkcraft and Mechanical Sciences buildings were destroyed. In addition, the centuries-old façade of the Lord Taylor Scaman Sr. Administrative Building was destroyed beyond hope of restoration (see page 9 for a feature on the façade's vast historical and cultural importance).

> The ex-professor's attack was halted by bold action from Social Sciences Department Chair Ykaterina Volkova, who slew Wollenstonecraft with a well-placed arrow to the chest. Material aid was provided by City Watch special response teams and President Swing himself, who charged headlong into gunfire and distracted the assailant long enough for Professor Volkova's shot.

> Professor Volkova was under investigation at the time of the attack for suspected involvement with the Ironworks explosion. In light of the events of the morning, all charges have been dropped, and City Watch sources say there is no further interest in Professor Volkova.
