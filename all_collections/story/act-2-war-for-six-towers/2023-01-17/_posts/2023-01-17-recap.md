To keep from having to wholesale slaughter the Gray Cloaks, the Nameless agreed to ambush City Councilmember, Leviathan Hunter super-owner, and their erstwhile bankroller . . . Lord Strangford. Strangford had been under investigation by the Gray Cloaks JUST before they were wrongfully kicked out of the force, and it was decided that his death would close the book on the gang war.

The ambush was set up in Brightstone's Unity Park, with cover provided by organizing a fight between noted wrestler Red Hot Dan Houston and teenage dumbass Jeremy "the Shmeek" Pendryn. 

Now, sure, the ambush broke down a little.  Strangford ended up bringing protection in the form of some sailors, a strange Whisper with a cat spirit (which has since possessed Donovan), and ultimately bribing Houston and the Shmeek to cover his retreat.

But all ended well when Casta, Katya's situationship-turned-relationship, sniped Strangford through the throat. The other sailors were killed, the Whisper was killed-ish, and both Houston and the Shmeek were folded into V-Sea-W's good graces.
