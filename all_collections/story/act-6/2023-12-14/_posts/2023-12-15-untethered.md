> Orianna stands in the dusty attic of a tenement she knows is important to her, but no longer feels like home. A pitiful altar adorned with a fragmented and steely sculpture, various aging tomes, notes and ritual markings stands against the far wall, next to an open journal marked with the names of various supernatural threats to the city. It feels foolish to have put so much hope and faith into all of this for so long. To have been so alone in her hopes. 

> If there is power in a union, it was not enough to protect the people that lurk in the shadows of Orianna’s mind, now shapeless, faceless. Not on the scale that Orianna knew. But a union of gods– of the forces that should dwell in earth and sky and water, the forces that nourish and destroy, and have felt the sting of failure as acutely as Orianna has… that sort of power cannot be ignored. The kind of power that can shake not only the pillars of the city’s elite, but against the darkness that oppresses all of mankind. 

> She looks to the shattered welding mask that lies next to the table, a memento of her last encounter with Wickham. Elia. Its function means little to her now. Quellin will know how to craft a finer one– one that will withstand the surge of power she needs to finally destroy her foes. The witches will know how to create something with the storm of spirits and skies that churns in her head and her heart. With that, she can begin to pursue the secrets of the ancient world in earnest– and protect the faithful against the machinations of the Cinder King’s so-called empire.
