The Nameless indirectly cause the destruction of a business vital to the economic and literal survival of Duskvol, and [Arkin](/wiki/arkin)'s conscience is now trapped in a bottle.

The Duskvol Ironworks is/was a substantial part of the industrial and civic apparatus that allows Leviathan hunting (and thus, the electricity that powers Duskvol and keeps it safe from the Deathlands). Its destruction is a BIG DEAL.

We have a perfect corpse facsimile of [Katya](/wiki/katya) lying around now.

COMPLETELY UNRELATED: The [V-Sea-W](/wiki/v-sea-w) locker room is full of dissent and irritability, doubtless compounded by poor gate numbers and a lackluster response to the Dwayne's championship run. While there are a few factors at play, one Christopher Canaan is smugly stoking the fires of revolt. The Dwayne is done with V-Sea-W.
