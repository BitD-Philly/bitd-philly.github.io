*Casta the bounty hunter hasn't stopped whistling since she departed from Unity Park, her good spirits seemingly bolstered by the half-covered body slung over her shoulder. She improvises a little softshoe routine as she makes her way up the stairs of a derelict building, and raps on the door to the tune of a popular lounge song.*

***"Special delivery!"*** *she sings out, a smile nearly bisecting her face,* ***"Get it while it's still warm!"***

*The door opens soundlessly, seemingly of its own accord. Casta bounces in, cheerfully slapping her burden down on a surprisingly expensive oaken table.*

***"Here ya go! One city noble, Leviathan captain, and concilmember combo, bolt-skewered to perfection!"*** *she trills at the other occupant of the room,* ***"And, b'cause you're SUCH a loyal customer, I added a little surprise!"***

*With great aplomb, she uncovers the bundle, revealing the corpse of Lord Strangford. It is as we saw it last, except seemingly covered in a fine dust of . . .*

***"That's right, you'll be able to feast on him with my secret combination of sixteen herbs and spices! It's sweet, with heat, for a little treat on your meat!"***

*She considers her words for a moment, as the second occupant approaches the body to inspect it.*

***". . . For the record, that's not a euphemism. I wouldn't recommend putting my dry rub on your genitals if you're gonna-"***

*"Why did you think," intones Lord Scurlock, still holding the wrist of the deceased Strangford, "that I was going to eat the body?"*

*This seems to wrong-foot Casta for a moment.*

***"Uhh . . . cuz you're a vampire, right? Ain't that what you do?"***

*A deep sigh seems to emanate from Lord Scurlock, who picks up the corpse as though it weighed nothing and begins to recede into the apartment. Casta, nonplussed, does not follow.*

***"Wait . . . then why did you want the body?"***
