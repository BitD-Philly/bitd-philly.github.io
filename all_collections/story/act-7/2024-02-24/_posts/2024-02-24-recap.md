Casta has flipped back to the Nameless by the power of L-word and is about to explain everything she knows about the meta-plot.

Your gang has been semi-accidentally set up to be the inciting parties for a theistic rebellion against the Immortal Emperor. You have the blood of one of his Chosen on your hands, and your group is already a collection of rebels, misfits, ne'er-do-wells, and cultists. Y'all will soon need to decide if you want to work very hard to cover this up, or lean into trying to topple the Emperor.
