A crack shot on a quest for vengeance.

# Appearance
Sizzle is a young woman with a slight, wiry build. She has steely grey eyes with a steady, focused gaze. Her curly blonde hair is long enough to brush her elbows when let loose, but more often than not is pulled back in a braid to keep it contained. Her clothes, well-worn but equally well-cared for, are cut in a style more reminiscent of the Imperial City than Duskvol. In addition, she wears a deep red cloak that can be pulled up to obscure the lower half of her face.

Two revolvers hang from her belt, the butt of their handles pointed forward. The guns themselves have a distinct copper sheen to them and are always freshly polished. The same leather used for the holsters has also been worked into bracers and close-fitting spaulders that provide a resting place for her hawk, Velvet.

## Velvet

Velvet is a harrier hawk with rust-colored, white-spotted feathers covering her body and long black and grey wing feathers. She has yellow-rimmed red eyes and a black, hooked beak.

# Story
## Backstory
Sizzle grew up an orphan in the Deathlands settlements near the Imperial City. 

## Time With the Nameless

Sizzle came to Duskvol searching for her [father](npcs#joseph-woodward), falling in with the Nameless shortly before the war with the Seventh Tower Consortium began.

Her first job with the Nameless was ensuring the smooth opening of [Deckherd Hall](six-towers#deckherd-hall) at the behest of [Captain Clelland](npcs#morgan-clelland). Investigation revealed the primary threat to be an attack by [Lugos](npcs#lugos), which was subsequently averted via an infiltration of [Claddadge Manor](brightstone#claddage-manor) that ended with the beheading of Lugos and the destruction of what remained of [Cassiopeia Beasby](npcs#cassiopeia-beasby). Sizzle agreed to owe [Casta](npcs#casta) a favor in exchange for keeping Lugos's head in the possession of the Nameless.

Upon learning that the newly opened Deckherd Hall was to feature [Chef François](npcs#francois), his rival [Giancarlo](npcs#giancarlo) asked the Nameless to intervene. In order to discredit and humiliate François, the Nameless, led by [Sandro](sandro) and [Flan](flan), presided over a takeover of the restaurant by the wrestlers of V-Sea-W with the intent of staging a widespread incident of food poisoning. Sizzle helped [Cruncho](cruncho) distract [Bea](npcs#bea), François's sous chef, while [Linmer](linmer) confronted François. The discovery and subsequent destruction of François's haunted meat grinder (not a euphemism) and an explosion of hagfish slime ultimately resulted in the deaths of François and Bea, with Bea's ghost posessing François' corpse.


# Relationship

* [Joseph Woodward](npcs#joseph-woodward): Sizzle's father and the reason she came to Duskvol. They are not on good terms.
* [Cruncho](cruncho): Spooky friend.
* [Arkin Wollstonecraft](arkin): Co-inventor of the coffee-grinder-gatling-gun[^1]
* [Valanthe](npcs#valanthe): Listens to Sizzle talk about pistol mechanisms for hours on end for some reason. Wears a mask Sizzle made.[^val-mask]
* [Casta](npcs#casta) (Rival): Sizzle has beaten her to one too many of her marks. Doesn't help that Sizzle looks like her younger sister, either.
* [Grace](npcs#grace): Fellow bounty hunter and contact.
