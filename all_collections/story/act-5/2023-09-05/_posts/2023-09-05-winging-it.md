The Horned One is not comfortable in Coran's body. They had forgotten about clothes nearly a millenium ago, and their brief time as a goose had not served to remind them. It had taken several gawking passerby to remind them that half of Coran's vestments had been blown off when they'd taken over. They'd stolen a shirt and trousers from a washing line, and a human had come out to dispute their taking. Throwing the human through a nearby window had not ended the commotion, but they'd escaped easily. The Horned One is very fast.

They sit in a warehouse now, seemingly abandoned in the excitement surrounding the Lightning Wall's near-collapse. They are surrounded by geese. They like the geese, and the geese seem to like them. 

At the urging of their companions beneath the waves, the Horned One sets their will into the minds of the geese. It is not as easy as it once was, but far easier now with a human body to draw upon. Coran will not survive their tenure, but his death will be worth it (thinks the Horned One).

*A SHIP. WE NEED A SHIP. HELP US PROCURE A SHIP.*

Honking obediently, the geese waddle off. The Horned One sits, and waits.
