***"Scurlock!"***

The dusty chamber is abandoned. The parchment is unwritten. The old woman is in another room, calling hoarsely.

***"Where the blazes are you? Scurlock!"***

The events of the past few days go unwritten, unconsumed. The divination is incomplete, and the knowledge is lost.

***"Where is Scurlock, Lugos? . . . Damn Blighter, that she gave you no mouth! ARGH!"***

Because of this, the sun will one day shine on the world again. Because of this, the Immortal Emperor may be defeated.

***"SCURLOCK!"***

Because of this, also, we have no faithful recording of events. Thus, we must turn to other sources.
