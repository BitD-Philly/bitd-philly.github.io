> # Collapse!
> ## Banking Backbone Bamboozled, Blasted!

> Noted private bank SALTFORD'S was ROBBED and DESTROYED by the NAMELESS this evening past.

> Working at the behest of CORPSE WITCH ELIA WICKHAMM, elsewise OLD WICKHAMM, elsewise YOUNG HAMWICK, members of the Nameless led a TWO-PRONGED DECEPTIVE ACTION through the bank's HAUNTED TELLERS and ELECTROPLASMIC MECHANISMS on the one hand, as well as conveying themselves through the HAUNTED WESTERN WALL of the REMNANTS of SKYDAGGER KEEP, the thousand-year-old ruins of which UNDERLIE SALTFORD'S BANK.

> By deceptive use of blood and taking advantage of the MAIMING of noted wrestler SEAN MCMICHAELS, the Nameless were able to penetrate the worldly form of Saltford's notorious vault. Elsewhere, within the HAUNTED ECHO of Skydagger Keep, a second group of Nameless was able to penetrate the ghostly form of the vault by a combination of VIOLENCE and INSPIRATION dealt to the PHANTOM LEGIONARIES that inhabited the ruins below. This dual-worldly access to the Vault allowed the Nameless to steal a LOCKBOX belonging to one LORD SCURLOCK. 

> In the process of dealing with the ENTANGLED SPIRIT of BHED THE WOLF, a rogue ELECTROPLASMIC TESLA COIL interacted with the ANCIENT GHOST FIELD and caused a MASS UNRAVELLING of the structure's bindings. The Saltford's structure is NO LONGER MAGICALLY SECURE and is DEEPLY UNSTABLE. BHED THE WOLF ROAMS FREE.
