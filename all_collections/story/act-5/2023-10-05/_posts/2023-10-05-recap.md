# Session Recap

Upon learning that the newly opened Deckherd Hall was to feature [Chef François](/wiki/npcs#francois), his rival [Giancarlo](/wiki/npcs#giancarlo) asked the Nameless to intervene. In order to discredit and humiliate François, the Nameless, led by [Sandro](/wiki/sandro) and [Flan](/wiki/flan), presided over a takeover of the restaurant by the wrestlers of V-Sea-W with the intent of staging a widespread incident of food poisoning. Sizzle helped [Cruncho](/wiki/cruncho) distract [Bea](/wiki/npcs#bea), François's sous chef, while [Linmer](/wiki/linmer) confronted François. The discovery and subsequent destruction of François's haunted meat grinder (not a euphemism) and an explosion of hagfish slime ultimately resulted in the deaths of François and Bea, with Bea's ghost posessing François' corpse.
