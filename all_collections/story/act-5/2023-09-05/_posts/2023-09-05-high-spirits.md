Boris Volkov is sitting at a table in Tangletown's only bar with Roslyn (who, as the Dimmer Sisters' main contact with the outside world, has a multitude of last names as needed). Boris is sipping contemplatively on a glass of water. Roslyn is six shots deep and not showing it.

*"Void Sea Wrestling, then . . . the marquee location, or one of the Billhooks' bastardizations?"* asks Roslyn, her voice clear as a bell even as she gestures for a seventh shot.

**"The main one, don't worry. I'll still be in Six Towers,"** shrugs Boris, **"The Box works great as a merch table and the like. Lots of people feeling big feelings, the roar of the crowd, the triumph, the heartbreak, the dreams . . . it's good. Probably better than anything Strauss would have given us, and the Sisters don't even have to generate extra silver to keep the arrangement going. People love their action figures."**

*"Quite. Well, the Sisters' guest is eating well at your trough, Mr. Volkov. Keep this up, and we'll have no reason to escalate things with the Nameless."*

Boris attempts a non-commital nod, and largely succeeds. If Roslyn notices the slight relaxation of his shoulders, and the relief it signifies, she gives no indication.

*"And are YOU happy, Boris?"* she asks suddenly, *"The Sisters are pleased with your commitment. They would not have Duskwall be a source of sadness, after all you have been through."*

Boris eyes her with some curiosity at this, and then shrugs again.

**". . . I have good days and bad days. Today isn't so bad."**

*"You ought to get OUT more, Boris! See the sights, experience the town! Duskwall has so much to offer, if you'll only look for it. This isn't called the Jewel of Akaros for nothing, you know!"*

She leans in suddenly, and all the color drains from her face. When she speaks, her voice is not her own.

*"IF ALL OF THE EMPIRE WERE FALLEN, AND THE EMPEROR FORCED TO RETAIN ONE SEAT OF POWER, HE WOULD PICK DUSKVOL. MARK THIS PLACE WELL, BORIS. THERE IS SO **MUCH** TO FIND."*

She sits back forcefully, gasping slightly as the color returns to her face. She looks up at Boris, and matches his burgeoning smile.

**"Well . . ."** grins Boris, quaffing his water, **"Far be it from me to question the Immortal Emperor . . ."**

He stands now, and there is a lightness to his step and a cheeriness to his gaze. Those strange words from Roslyn's mouth have made him a new man.

**"You're right, Ros! I think I'll be a tourist for a bit. Take a walk, see the sights . . . Get some exercise! See you tonight, eh?"**

She winks at him as he strides towards the door. He starts to laugh as he leaves Tangletown, unable to contain the new joy bubbling inside of him. His hilarity brightens the day of passerby, because they don't know that every chortle promises a body count.
