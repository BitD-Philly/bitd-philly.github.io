excerpt: A powerful gang based in the Docks, currently recovering from an internal power struggle.
---

A powerful but fractured gang based in The Docks who does business out of their butcher shops. The Billhooks' leader, Tarvul, has recently escaped from prison with the help of the Nameless[^tarvul-escape] and is consolidating his power among the fractured Billhooks.

# Major Events
## Lightning Wall Sabotage and the death of Coran

[needs more details on lightning wall incident]

Coran was a rival for control of the Billhooks in Tarvul's absence until the Nameless accidentally turned him into a vessel for [The Horned One](npcs#the-horned-one). A handful of Billhooks remain loyal to Coran, but their numbers are dwindling.

## Seventh Tower War

Under Erin's lead, the Billhooks allied with the [Seventh Tower Consortium](factions#seventh-tower-consortium) against the Nameless during the War of Six Towers. Major events include the battle for the docks, the Unity Day bombing, and the escape of Tarvul.

[Dock battle details coming soon]

[unity day bombing details coming soon]

On Unity Day, the Nameless helped Tarvul break out of Ironhook prison, faking his death in the process. They were nearly thwarted by [Nat Marseilles](npcs#nat-marseilles) and [Chuck Morgenstern](npcs#chuck-morgenstern), who tried to sabotage the breakout and frame the Nameless for Tarvul's murder. However, a combination of tazing, incredible abdominal strength, a rocket-powered cart, and some good old-fashioned cop-killing saw the Nameless triumphant as a bloodied but living Tarvul climactically strode into the Billhooks' Unity Day festivities and retook his rightful place. As a result, the Billhooks withdrew from the war[^tarvul-escape].
