Anyone meeting Flan Sonata would have a hard time picking him out again in a crowd, because he is an almost sarcastically nondescript half-Iruvian artist-for-hire. Raised by distant relatives, he accidentally stumbled into the illustration business by designing a logo for his uncle for "Longer Lobster" tinned centipedes, and now does a healthy business with portraits (alive or dead), pulp newspaper illustrations, gang fan art, and party caricatures. He's also a thief who has a thriving side-racket in doing score surveillance, like scoping out a target while sketching couples in the park. He likes doing crime and hears the Nameless are very good at it.[^intro-post]

Superfan and major patron of the all-hull band *Knife Crab*.
