Seventh Tower continues its bulldozing rampage against the Nameless, with the assistance of the Billhooks and their organization. THIS time, they're targeting the Fog Hounds, and it's on multiple fronts:

To the one side, certain journalistic organizations (including the *Duskwall Independent*) are being fed information about "a group of smugglers with covert insurgent ties". The more responsible outlets are vetting information, but the other 98% are running with it.

For the other side, the Fog Hounds are having increasing difficulty finding the physical SPACE to dock, as the Billhooks are having it be known that they are not welcome to dock at . . . well, at the Docks!
