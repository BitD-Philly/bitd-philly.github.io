A powerful but fractured gang based in [The Docks](locations#the-docks) who does business out of their butcher shops. The Billhooks' leader, Tarvul, is consolidating his power among the fractured Billhooks after the Nameless helped him escape from prison.

# Major Events
## Lightning Wall Sabotage and the death of Coran

[needs more details on lightning wall incident]

[Coran](npcs#coran) was a rival for control of the Billhooks in Tarvul's absence until the Nameless accidentally turned him into a vessel for [The Horned One](npcs#the-horned-one). A handful of Billhooks remain loyal to Coran, but their numbers are dwindling.

## The War of Sevens

Under [Erin](npcs#erin)'s lead, the Billhooks allied with the [Seventh Tower Consortium](factions#seventh-tower-consortium) against the Nameless during the War of Six Towers. Major events include the battle for the docks, the Unity Day bombing, and the escape of Tarvul.

[Dock battle details coming soon]

[unity day bombing details coming soon]

On Unity Day, the Nameless helped Tarvul break out of Ironhook prison, faking his death in the process. They were nearly thwarted by [Nat Marseilles](npcs#nat-marseilles) and [Chuck Morgenstern](npcs#chuck-morgenstern), who tried to sabotage the breakout and frame the Nameless for Tarvul's murder. However, a combination of tazing, incredible abdominal strength, a rocket-powered cart, and some good old-fashioned cop-killing saw the Nameless triumphant as a bloodied but living Tarvul climactically strode into the Billhooks' Unity Day festivities and retook his rightful place. As a result, the Billhooks withdrew from the war[^tarvul-escape].
