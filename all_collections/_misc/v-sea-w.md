---

Whether you're a dockside worker looking for a break or someone who wants some petty, reliable drama, Void Sea Wrestling is the place to be every Sunday night. The stakes are high and theres always bound to be some rowdy action happening at the outdoor arena that dominates this [Six Towers](six-towers) game hall.

Void Sea Wrestling is an enterprise owned and run by The Nameless after the seizure of the building during a war with the [Gray Cloaks](factions#graycloaks) early on in their career. Now, its a thriving scene, managed by the cunning and charismatic faces of the Nameless. A bar, gambling hall, and drug den flank the main facility, and the place has survived multiple sieges during the Nameless' tenure in Six Towers.

# Current Status
Currently, Void Sea Wrestling is not a factor for the Nameless and their income, after they faked their deaths and ceded it temporarily to The Seventh Tower Consortium. As part of the faked loss of the establishment, the wrestlers were promised a look at their contracts, and began the process towards unionization.[^throw-the-match]

During normal operations, VSW provides an income of 2 coins per week. However, the relative freedom currently afforded to the Wrestlers and their handler, BL Scoundrel, makes it so that every third session of play there is a wrestling-involved complication to the job that the Nameless are trying to pull off.

## Singles Talent

* The Iruvian Sheik -- Arcade, does not respect V-Sea-W, stepped away from the creative side

* Francis Jacob Michaelman aka FMJ -- the worst rich kid you've ever met

* The She-Wolf of Severos -- [Katya](katya)'s other moonlighting gig

## Injured Talent

* Cactus Joe (nice guy, takes a lot of pain, INJURED)

* ~~Sean McMichaels (A short king entering phase two of his career, the grave)~~

# Franchising

As part of an attempt to build a relationship with the [Billhooks](the-billhooks), the Nameless helped incorporate some of the dockside fihting pits into a broader "VSW" label, known as V8. The fights at these other fight pits are harder, colder, and more brutal. Rather than sourcing VSW actors for their shows, these pits are fueled by local talent, that is to say, shipboard fighters looking for a chance to hurt eachtother. 

Many of these pits closed due to the Billhooks siding againt the Nameless in the War of Sevens, and the future is uncertain for those that remain open.[^war-of-sevens]
