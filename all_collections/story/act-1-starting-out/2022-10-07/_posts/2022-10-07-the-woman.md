A woman sits in a darkened room, old finery covered in cobwebs and dust cloths. She is covered by an old robe, with a shawl that might itself resemble a dusty cobweb. Her hair is gray and wild, and her eyes are flint-black.

She finishes writing on the parchment she is bent over. We see it is a parody of a newspaper article, written in a spidery scrawl.

She looks down at her finished work, smiles, and eats the paper. Her eyes and mouth briefly glow blue.

Having done that, she leaps into the air and lands feet-first on the ceiling. She does not fall, but rather stands there, as though gravity has gotten a bit confused (as, indeed, it has). She curls herself into a sitting position ... and waits.
