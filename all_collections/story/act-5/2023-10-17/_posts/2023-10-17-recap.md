[Seventh Tower Consortium](/wiki/seventh-tower) is gentrifying [Six Towers](/wiki/six-towers) out from under you   
There are Imperial weapons involved   
And a spooky [man in a hat](/wiki/joseph-woodward)   
Roslyn of the [Dimmer Sisters](/wiki/factions#dimmer-sisters) is dead, but you’ve framed it on Seventh Tower Consortium!


[Grace the assassin](/wiki/npcs#grace) is here to:
1. Kill Eckherd Deckherd
2. Kill [Myleria Klev](/wiki/npcs#myleria-klev) of the [Red Sashes](/wiki/factions#red-sashes)
3. Frame someone (the Nameless) for both of these deaths.
4. Cause a brief lightning wall failure to the west

Realizing that she has overextended herself (it happens in this capitalist grindset society!), she has contacted her friend [Sizzle](/wiki/sizzle) and her divinely(?)-ordained ally [Cruncho](/cruncho) to help her out with these two jobs!

Eckherd is dead and framed in a way that will NEVER STICK IN COURT

the Crows and Black Knights are IN the city!

[Valanthe](/wiki/npcs#valanthe) has a date with Sizzle over firearms

[Render](/wiki/npcs#render) is 6-8 weeks away

The Nameless are at War with Seventh Tower Consortium and sort of also the [Billhooks](/wiki/billhooks)!

The Red Sash’s leader survived an assassination attempt through an untraceable anonymous tip so you’re going into this shit with your allies intact!
