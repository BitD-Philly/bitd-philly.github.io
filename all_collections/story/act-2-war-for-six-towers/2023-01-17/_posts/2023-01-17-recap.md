The Gray Cloaks sued for peace in exchange for a shot at Strangford (with you guys organizing the meet/ambush point). They’ve essentially burnt themselves out as an organization, and will not be a concern going forward. The war is won!

Need a place to arrange a meet/ambush point for Lord Strangford, in exchange for peace with the Gray Cloaks? Unity Park. Problem with Unity Park? Favored high schooler makeout spot. Solution? Throw a rager. How do you throw a rager? GET THE SHMEEK TO FIGHT A DUDE.

And when you gotta get a dude to fight the Shmeek and you’re the manager of V-Sea-W, there’s only one name in the phone book, AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE, CUZ RED HOT DAN HOUSTON SAID SO. 

How did Strangford get away? He paid the Shmeek and Red Hot Dan Houston a sack of money to cover his escape when then ambush started.
