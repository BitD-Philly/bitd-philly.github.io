Haike Yarabax (*Hay-kuh Yah-rah-bash*) was raised in Iruvia. They are half Severosi by blood but feel very disconnected from their heritage, as it wasn't emphasized growing up which is a sore spot for them. They had a promising career as a statistician and social scientist until their big mouth got them into trouble and they were used as a scapegoat for political controversy. No longer able to pull strings from the inside and feeling hopeless about change, they fell deep into nihilism.   After familial estrangement and diminishing funds they met a new friend and through them found a new path in the criminal world.
