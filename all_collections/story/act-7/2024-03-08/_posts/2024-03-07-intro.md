Arthur Pendryn has contacted the Nameless, discreetly. Apparently a task force from the Bluecoats has sliced through a ton of legal red tape to search his house, on some suspicion of heresy and treason. As the Nameless know that Pendryn routinely hosts heresy and, arguably, treason, this could have a baaaad knock-on effect for the crew. Pendryn is willing to pay 10 coin for a rush job.
