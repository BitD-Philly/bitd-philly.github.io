full-name: Void Sea Wrestling
w-id: v-sea-w

desc: Duskvol's premiere wrestling fight pit entertainment consortium in the Six Towers neighborhood, run by the Nameless.
---

Void Sea Wrestling is an enterprise owned and run by The Nameless after the seizure of the building during a war with the [Gray Cloaks](factions#graycloaks) early on in their career. Now, its a thriving scene, managed by the cunning and charismatic faces of the Nameless.

Whether you're a dockside worker looking for a break or someone who wants some petty, reliable drama, Void Sea Wrestling is the place to be every Sunday night. The stakes are high and theres always bound to be some rowdy action happening at the outdoor arena that dominates this [Six Towers](six-towers) game hall.




# Current Status

V-Sea-W has officially returned after the Nameless acquisition of Deckherd Hall[^too-many-cooks-llc] (now [The Arena](deckherd-hall)) and the staging of *DuskViolence II: Super Omega MAX Ultra Supreme Vortex*.[^valentine-sea-wrestling]

During normal operations, VSW provides an income of 2 coins per week. However, the relative freedom currently afforded to the Wrestlers and their handler, BL Scoundrel, makes it so that every third session of play there is a wrestling-involved complication to the job that the Nameless are trying to pull off.

## Singles Talent

* The Iruvian Sheik -- Arcade, does not respect V-Sea-W, stepped away from the creative side
* Kristen Landstadter -- Claims to be an alien. Nobody is quite sure how to disprove this
* Francis Jacob Michaelman aka FMJ -- the worst rich kid you've ever met
* [The Shmeek](npcs#jeremy-pendryn) -- the Next Big Thing. Sink or swim time, kid.
* Handausen -- Very good, very mean. Meme wrestler extraordinaire
* Ben Heart -- profoundly accomplished technical fighter with no charisma
* Apple Cassandra -- the laziest wrestler ever, yet deceptively skilled
* Abel -- The Pallbearer's "brother", don't ask about his politics
* Ventrue -- Vampire gimmick, not a vampire
* Boss Bigman -- Bluecoat gimmick, barely sane
* The She-Wolf of Severos -- [Katya](katya)'s other moonlighting gig
* Mousewing -- Hull of [Arkin Wollstonecraft](arkin), defender of justice and sidekick to the Spider
* Ludo -- trashcan killbot
* [Jammer](jammer) -- champion for love
* Rock "The Dwayne" Johnson -- back after a stint as an actor. Everyone except him is annoyed by this.

## Injured Talent

* The Pallbearer -- no longer the Akarosi Asskicker nor pretending to be a [Deathlands Scavenger](factions#deathlands-scavengers) since being stabbed by real Deathlands Scavengers.[^duskviolence] Bitter he was not invited to perform at Duskviolence II.
* Red Hot Dan Houston -- working-class hero, alcoholic. Suffered a heart attack onstage at Duskviolence II.[^valentine-sea-wrestling]


## Former Talent
* Cactus Joe (Retired) - nice guy, takes a lot of pain. Now a bartender at the Chant and Coven bar in [Nightmarket](locations#nightmarket).[^valentine-sea-wrestling]
* Sean McMichaels (Deceased) - A short king entering phase two of his career, the grave.

## Guest Stars
* Eduardo & Rodrigo - Moustache-twirling, vulgar, and eight feet tall. Technically competent fighters. Bad actors.
* [The Spider](npcs#claire-strangford) - superhero theme with technological gimmicks. The hero Duskvol deserves.

# Arenas

## The Arena

[in progress]

## Historic
The historic V-Sea-W arena was acquired from the [Gray Cloaks](gray-cloaks). Originally a large spa with a pool, it was been converted into an outdoor wrestling arena, replete with an attached gambling den with two stories, and flanked by watchtowers that double as changing rooms. The historic arena was lost after The Nameless faked their deaths and ceded it to The [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower). As part of the faked loss of the establishment, the wrestlers were promised a look at their contracts, and began the process towards unionization.[^throw-the-match]

Despite the arena being named a historic landmark by the Ministry of Preservation, Seventh Tower razed it to the ground with the intent to rebuild, but the [War of Sevens](/story/act-6) depleted their resources, making them unable to complete the construction.  

## Franchising

As part of an attempt to build a relationship with the [Billhooks](billhooks), the Nameless helped incorporate some of the dockside fihting pits into a broader "VSW" label, known as V8. The fights at these other fight pits are harder, colder, and more brutal. Rather than sourcing VSW actors for their shows, these pits are fueled by local talent, that is to say, shipboard fighters looking for a chance to hurt eachtother. 

Many of these pits closed due to the Billhooks siding againt the Nameless in the [War of Sevens](/story/act-6), and the future is uncertain for those that remain open.[^war-of-sevens]
