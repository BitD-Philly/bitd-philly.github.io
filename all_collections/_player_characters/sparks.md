Sparks is an up-and-coming minor serial arsonist who seems to only ever target governmental property. As far as anyone knows, they have never been responsible for any deaths or damage to anything incredibly important, so nobody has put much effort into hunting them down as there's always more important issues at hand. But, they are a leading cause in the fiery destruction of old unused governmental buildings and minor beureaucratic documents. But recently, they have been looking for a way to get more cash to fund their escapades and have joined the Nameless as a way to get that cash, unaware that he is now working alongside his [brother](arkin). But that will change soon.


# Appearance
Short, skinny, and showing signs of early male pattern baldness. Often seen wearing some nondescript and vaugly official looking beureaucratic outfit with a fire resistant cloak.

# Story
## Backstory
Arvin Wollstonecraft was a mid level bureaucrat with moderate prospects. Arvin had been working in the capital for a few years now in a boring governmental job filled with far too much paperwork, middle management, and red tape. However, after reports of his brother [Arkin](arkin)â€™s threats at the university and subsequent death[^the-madmans-assault], Arvin was unceremonously demoted and blacklisted from the capital, moving back to his hometown. Now, working a dead end governmental position, Arvin toils away knowing he'll never be able to climb the corporate ladder.
