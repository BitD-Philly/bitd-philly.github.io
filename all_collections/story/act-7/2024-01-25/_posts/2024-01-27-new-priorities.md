*This was **supposed** to be simple. A bullet to the chest, fair payment for her mother's life and her own lost childhood. But the bullet didn't take, and now everything was more complicated than it had any right being.*

*She leaned against the frame of the open vault door, hawk on her shoulder, looking down at Woodward. Rumpled finery, unfocused gaze, muttering under his breath.*

*She had won, hadn't she? He'd been cut off from everything he worked to build, reduced to a shell of a man, his debt finally paid in full. Yet... nothing about this felt like a victory. No pride, no satisfaction, no sense of accomplishment. Only a deep, aching loss.*

*Unprompted, Melver's words echoed in her head.*
***"Four parts business..."***

 *Abruptly, she stood and disappeared from the doorframe, only to appear a moment later holding the cushioned armchair that had been sitting by the door. She set the chair down next to Woodward, then picked up the fur coat piled on the seat, the copy of* Munitions Monthly *dropping unceremoniously to the floor.*

***"One part ghost glue..."***

*It was easy enough to get him in the chair. He didn't fight, didn't protest, and he was lighter than he had been a week ago. She cut the cord binding his wrists, covering him with the coat before settling down cross-legged on the floor. Velvet dropped to perch on her knee as she leaned back against the wall.*

*She took a deep breath.*

***"... One part Joe."***

"Hey, dad."

"I--   
"... it's Rosie."

"I just--   
"I guess--   
"um, if you're still in there somewhere..."

"I... wanna tell you about me. About where I've been, who I am. What--   
"-- what I've done."
