Dr. Arkin Wollstonecraft was an up-and-coming associate professor of the mechanical sciences at Duskvol Academy, until his colleagues found out about the unspeakable cybernetic horrors he was creating in his basement office. Now, he has turned to crime to fund his macabre inventions, as he seeks to push the boundaries of what it means to be human and/or a [clockwork being](the-clockmaker). Also he has a *slight* opium addiction but he can totally stop at any time.
