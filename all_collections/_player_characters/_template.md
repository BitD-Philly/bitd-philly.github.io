This is a character wiki page! Write a short summary about your character here at the top of the page. Below are some additional suggested sections.

You can link to other wiki pages like this:`[link text](link-target)`, where `link text` is the text that is written on the page and `link-target` is the name of the page you are linking to.

**Note that valid links lowercase and spaces must be replaced with dashes (-).**

Examples:
* [Duskvol](duskvol)
* The [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower-consortium)

You can also link to sub-headers on any page by using a # after the `link-text`. For example, linking to Cruncho's backstory would look like this:

`Due to Cruncho's [personal history](cruncho#backstory) with football, he was able to...`
