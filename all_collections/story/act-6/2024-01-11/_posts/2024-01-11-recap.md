The infant Duskvol Palisade Avenue stock exchange was blown up and subsequently mashed through thanks to a superhuman Black Knight vs. half-possessed warlock vs. brick shithouse pit-fighter brawl (s/o [Cruncho](/wiki/Cruncho) and [Spud](/wiki/spud)).

-The proposed gala celebrating its unveiling became a nightmare riot courtesy of our gang, [the Shmeek](/wiki/npcs#jeremy-pendryn), explosions, and shouting "fire" in a crowded room (tandem work from [Arkin](/wiki/arkin), [Linmer](/wiki/linmer), and [Sandro](/wiki/sandro)).

-[Sizzle](/wiki/sizzle) has captured [Joseph Woodward](/wiki/joseph-woodward) aka the Man in the Hat and (temporarily) severed him from the ghost field.

-The entire narrative has been spread to the newspapers courtesy of Sandro's media acumen: free market venture capitalism is a fraud, [Seventh Tower](/wiki/seventh-tower) are hucksters of the highest order, and law enforcement is investigating them (now headed up by [Nat Marseilles](/wiki/npcs#nat-marseilles)).

-[Chuck Morgenstern](/wiki/npcs#chuck-morgenstern) may be dead, or seriously injured

-Linmer has distilled and caused the capture of another [Blighter](/wiki/npcs#blighter) iteration

-Y'all stole some fur coats from coat check.

-[Bhed the Wolf](/wiki/npcs#bhed-the-wolf) "lives" in Cruncho's skeleton now.
