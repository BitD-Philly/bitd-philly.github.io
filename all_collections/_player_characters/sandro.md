Sandro does make a lot of really above-board deals (Billhooks, oops-I-unionized-the-wrestlers) but also cheerfully lies a lot- inventing young Jimothy for the wrestlers, selling tenements he doesn't own.

# Beliefs & Drives

* **Make no small plans.** Sandro loves to swing big - he has a habit of walking right up to major players with the goal of directly working a deal or scamming them. 

* **Reward loyalty; destroy traitors.** Sandro really does seem to like to make friends and bring enemies onboard, but he also can get pretty nasty toward clearly defined enemies; this is, metafictionally, the fact that defeating enemies with wacky plans is *fun*.

* Friend 1
