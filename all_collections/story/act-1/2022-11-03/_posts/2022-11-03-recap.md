The Nameless made enough of a mess to attract the ire of the [Spirit Wardens](/wiki/factions#spirit-wardens). Rather than wishing to go to war against an influential and elusive organization of government ghost-hunters, the Nameless agreed to frame Captain [Winslow Dunleavy](/wiki/npcs#winslow-dunleavy) (of the Leviathan Hunter *Lightning*) as a Spirit Warden himself. 

A plan was hatched to drug the debaucherous captain, place him in the midst of a faked supernatural incident, and allow him to be seen by whatever interested parties were out for the Spirit Wardens. 

This plan immediately fell through when the drugs administered to Dunleavy slew him nigh-instantaneously. Undeterred, the Nameless changed the narrative to imply (successfully, it would seem) that Winslow Dunleavy had given his life as a Spirit Warden fighting against an unspecified demonic threat. Thus, war between the Spirit Wardens and the Nameless was averted.
