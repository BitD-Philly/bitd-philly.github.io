*A shadowy figure returns to their ground-level apartment to find the window broken. They let out a strangled cry and rush inside.*

*The single room is a mess. A table has been overturned, cookware is scattered everywhere. Ceramic sherds cover the floor.*

*The figure goes stock-still . . . and picks up a semi-intact ceramic dog. The neck is covered in teeth marks, and the head is missing.*

*A low, almost animal groan issues from the figure. They sink to their knees. Tears fall upon the broken ceramic. The groan becomes a roar, a snarl . . . and then the figure is silent.*

*The figure retrieves a hammer from beneath their wash basin, and retreats into the bedroom. We hear the smashing of wood.*

*When the figure emerges from the bedroom, they are transformed. Layers of armor and bandoliers of ammunition are poorly concealed by a long military coat, all insignia and sign of rank torn off. They wear a gas mask not dissimilar to that of a Deathlands Scavenger. A rifle crosses their back, and a longsword is sheathed at their hip. Their every step clanks with concealed gadgetry and weaponry.*

*They do not bother closing the door behind them. They will not return to this place.*
