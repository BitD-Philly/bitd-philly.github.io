# Appearance
Linmer may be in his 50s, but he looks like he is in his 70s, thanks to a combination of a hard life and a little bit of exaggerated costuming.  He has a ring of light grey hair around his bald head, a long white beard, and a thin, weathered face with a sharp features.

He puts on a show of bad posture to give an impression of frailty and age.  He often has a tight-lipped expression of strain, nervousness, and worry, because he _is_ strained, nervous, and worried.

He usually wears loose, dirty clothes.  His work with alchemicals have left small burns and discoloration on his fingers.  When he isn't on a job or trying to be ignored, he will wear colored beads braided into his beard.

# Story
## Backstory
Linmer knows he must have had a life before he was an orphan and before he was a stowaway, but he doesn't remember it.  He has spent his whole life traveling from port to port, occasionally taking on odd jobs but mostly trying to appear pitiful enough to be ignored by the rest of the ship.  At some point, an oils merchant took an interest in and taught him some alchemistry.  This apprenticeship gave him skills that, for the first time in his life, made him _actually valuable_ to other people. However, Linmer's delight in reckless experimentation soon destroyed his relationship with his mentor.  Over the years that followed, it also earned him a reputation with enough sailors from enough ships that stowing away ceased to be an option.

And so, he made land as Duskvol, with no money and no prospects.

# Relationships
Create lists using asterisks:

* Stazia:  Friend.  An apothacary.  She and Linmer have a lightly flirtatious relationship.  They met during one of Linmer's stints as a legitimate merchant's assistant.
* Veldren:  Enemy.  A "psychonaut".  It is unclear why Veldren and Linmer do not like each other. 
* Ol' Wickham:  Enemy?  A ghost.  Wickham rode along in Linmer's brain for several months.  By the time Linmer was able to drive him out, Linmer's antagonistic, fearful, and antagonistic perspective towards the ghost had... softened.
* Studabaker Spud:  Enemy?  An entreprenuer.  Linmer sees something of himself in this weird man, which led to him treating him more kindly than Spud perhaps deserved.
* Lord Pendryn:  Ally?  A noble and a cultist.  Linmer has found Lord Pendryn very helpful, but also a _bit much_.
* Lady Pendryn:  Enemy.  A noble.  She finds Linmer exceptionally annoying, but he hasn't been _so_ annoying to earn active antagonism from her.
* Jeremy "The Shmeek" Pendryn:  Ally?  A noble's child.
* Arkin / "The Clockmaker":  Crew/Enemy?
* Katya:  Crew.
* Flan:  Crew.
* Loop:  Crew.
* Cruncho:  Crew.
* Jammer:  Crew.
* Orianna:  Crew.
* Sizzle:  Crew.
* Sandro:  Crew.
