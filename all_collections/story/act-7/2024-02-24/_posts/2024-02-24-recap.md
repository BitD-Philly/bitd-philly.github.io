Casta has flipped back to the Nameless by the power of L-word and explains everything she knows about the meta-plot.

To make a long story short, the gang has been semi-accidentally set up to be the inciting parties for a theistic rebellion against the Immortal Emperor. They have the blood of one of his Chosen on their hands, and are already a collection of rebels, misfits, ne'er-do-wells, and cultists. The Namelesss will soon need to decide if they want to work very hard to cover this up, or lean into trying to topple the Emperor.

[***Technically*** *this is a roleplay thread on the Discord rather than a play session, but the info is still very important & should be citable!!*]
