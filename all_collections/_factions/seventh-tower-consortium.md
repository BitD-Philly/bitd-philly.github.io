The Seventh Tower Consortium is a mysterious organization with deep pockets and an interest in expanding into the [Six Towers](six-towers) district of [Duskvol](duskvol), restoring it to its former wealth and influence. They currently operate out of [Deckherd Hall](six-towers#deckherd-hall).

# Notable Members and Associates

* The [Man in the Hat](npcs#joseph-woodward), an ambitious ladder-climber and head of estate acquisitions in Six Towers. Inconsistently corporeal, occasionally dissipates into black smoke.
* [Studebaker Spud](npcs#studebaker-spud), an entrepeneur and useful idiot whose debts have been cleared by the Seventh Tower Consortium in exchange for his work on the restoration and management of Deckherd Hall.
