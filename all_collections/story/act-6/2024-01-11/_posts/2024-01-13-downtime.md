## Cruncho

>  Cruncho taking all that time to heal from fuckin' spending himself. And then paying out of his own coffers to fund some pro bono plumbing work; with all this bananas-crazy stuff happening, Cruncho uses this simple & straightforward work as a way to ground himself. To remind himself where he came from. That before there was Cruncho, there was Vilhelm. With the recent introduction of new minds into his head, he needed this time to recenter himself. 

## Sizzle

> Before Woodward wakes up, Sizzle sequesters him in the Nameless's vault, loots whatever was in his pockets, and gets some biosamples (hair, blood, and the like -- she asks Valanthe to give her a hand with the needles) with the intent to study the nature of his connection with the ghost field -- since it seems unlikely he'll stick around after Linmer's concoction wears off.

> She leaves a copy of Sandro's newspaper article on top of him, places a nice plush chair outside the holding cell, curls up with a copy of "Munitions Monthly", and waits for him to come to. 

> For the first time in her life, she is comfortable.
