> We are saddened to report the passing of ROBERT SPANZERVICH, better known by his nom de guerre SEVEROSI BOBBY. Reports indicate that he fell or was pushed from a height after suffering a sudden incapacitating electroplasmic shock.

> Severosi Bobby was known throughout Coalridge as a mountain of a man, and a pillar of his community. A sailor by trade, he spent much of his life upon the sea, helping to hunt the dread Leviathans that keep our city safe and illuminated. In his hours of leisure, he was often found at the Sparkwright's Institute in Coalrdige, where he spent many an hour as a volunteer handyman and general security. A utopian, Severosi Bobby believed in the development of alternative energy sources, and was often known to remark that an alternative to Leviathan ichor might put an end to his employment, but he'd "happily sit on dole if Doskvol's future is secured."

> Severosi Bobby is survived by his brother, Severosi Robert, and his parents, Severosi Mike and Severosi Gertrude. At the request of the family, all well-wishers are asked to donate to the Stray Puppies and Kittens Trust, as this was a cause very near to Severosi Bobby's heart.
