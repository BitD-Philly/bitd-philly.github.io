Anyone meeting Flan Sonata would have a hard time picking him out again in a crowd, because he is an almost sarcastically nondescript half-Iruvian artist-for-hire. Raised by distant relatives, he accidentally stumbled into the illustration business by designing a logo for his uncle for "Longer Lobster" tinned centipedes, and now does a healthy business with portraits (alive or dead), pulp newspaper illustrations, gang fan art, and party caricatures. He's also a thief who has a thriving side-racket in doing score surveillance, like scoping out a target while sketching couples in the park. He likes doing crime and hears the Nameless are very good at it.

Superfan and prominent sponsor of the all-hull band *Knife Crab*.

# Appearance
Weaponizingly nondescript - an underfed looking, average man with floppy black hair, in his late 20s, plainly dressed, carrying artist's supplies in a beat up bag.[^intro-post]

# Story
## Backstory
Flan grew up in Barrowcleft and worked in the family business (canned centipede meat) until going full freelance as an art criminal. He rents space in a shared bed in Silkshore with two other freelancers (they sleep in shifts) and puts the majority of his coin toward supporting Knife Crab's constant Hull Repair needs. Willing to art gig for: illustrated news stories, party caricatures, death pictures, sweetheart pictures, fanart, but will NOT do children's birthday parties.

## Time With the Nameless
Flan is a drop-in-drop-out Lurk whose first mission with the Nameless was breaking into a bank to steal a safe deposit box for a terrifying trickster ghost, which really set the tone for every subsequent job. His infrequent appearances mean each time he pops in for a Pick Up Crime, he walks into a wildly surprising and dangerous new situation, which honestly keeps it interesting. 
A self-described medium helpful criminal, he mostly focuses on gathering info for scores and sleight of handy thefts. With zero martial prowess, and a muppety fighting style, he's never successfully defeated anyone in actual combat. Scoped Deckherd Hall's layout. Stole Francois' personal papers. Sandro and him invented "Jimothy," a fake moppet designed to guilt wrestlers into behaving. Created fake meat props to setup the Billhooks. Swung a wrecking ball into a line of Billhooks during a Red Sash assault and lost a kidney to a pissed-off Crow in same score. 
Is deadly serious about bodyguarding precious Giancarlo.


# Relationships

* Frake, a locksmith: Loudly opinionated about the demerits of arcane (vs. mechanical) locks. 
* Giancarlo: chef extraordinaire and Flan's hero. Currently deeply disappointed in Flan's hucksterism.
* Studebaker Stud: briefly hired as an in-house caricaturist for the lobby.
* Inkrakes: freelance worker for various newspapers.
* Bea & Francois: helped Linmer kill Bea by lobbing slime at Bea during the food heist.
* Cassiopeia Beasby: cut her head off her vampiric corpse when they found her under a bed.
* Gert & the Art Guerrillas: thwarted Gert's loud attempts to ridealong on a heist, but made it up to her and her club later.
* The Alwyss Enterloch Gallery: stole works of Christopher Agadir for the curator from the Claddage Manor.
* "Snake" a 16 year old Billhook in training with aspirations for a dope arm tattoo. Flan encouraged her to lean into this persona when sneaking evidence into the Butcher Shop.
* Darmot, a Bluecoat: arrested Flan just a few too many times, since his patrol route includes the city square where Flan does a lot of his sketching/loitering.
