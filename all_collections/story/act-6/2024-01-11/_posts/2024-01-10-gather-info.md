Linmer has been cooped up for quite some time, keeping his head down to maintain the illusion that the Nameless are still short on manpower.  Now, though, he slips out of the crew's lair and slinks across rooftops, heading to a canal.

Canals crisscross the city.  Sit by one long enough, and you are bound to see something floating by.

He follows the web to the site of the new construction.  He watches to see who and what goes in.  He looks for an opportunity to slip inside and take a look around after hours.  While he waits, he listens in for shouts and grumbles, any sign of things going wrong.

The luxury apartments all look like typical small-scale amenity-heavy upper-class living options . . . except at the heart of each of them, there is a large room with a humming Sparkcraft device about the size of a two-story building. It hums, pulses, sparks, and whirrs at different occasions, and appears to be constantly issuing paper with numbers and letters on it. It is under HEAVY guard.

Sizzle observes engineers associated with the Seventh Tower laying in lines across the city. Some of them look like they’re just in common junctions hooked up to areas within Charterhall and portions of Six Towers that still have electroplasm.

However, there are some lines being laid . . . Into Nightmarket? And Charterhall? They don’t look like the other conventional lines. These non-electroplasmic lines appear to link up with telegraphic transmission lines (by no means in common use, but extant within the empire) going out of Charterhall and Gaddoc Rail Station. These are communication lines between the machines, a major seat of government administration, and one of the choke points between Duskwall and the rest of the Empire.

As Cruncho examines the guards going in, he notes that every single one of them has been enhanced in some way. Some show signs of Sparkcraft additions. Some show signs of biological modifications. And all of them have a ghost field signature that is markedly similar to Blighter.

When asked, Blighter informs Cruncho that an increasing number of Seventh Tower footsoldiers are currently playing host to an instance of herself, including the soldier Cruncho had gotten her off of. Doubtless the enhancements are the product of these other Blighter instances working on modifying their hosts. Every Seventh Tower footsoldier will be a formidable threat on their own.

Blighter (Cruncho's Blighter, anyway) is not concerned by the existential implications of there being multiple consciousnesses identical to her own out there, as she is supremely confident that she is the superior Blighter.

Sandro does his damndest to gather intel about the party by claiming to be the personal assistant for a Very Important noble. He finds the internal VIP list (being the people that the Seventh Tower really wants to impress) includes:

- The Mayor
- Representatives of the local noble houses, including the Pendryns
- Various private bankers
- Ironclad owners
- Non-noble industrialists
- University leadership

Notable by their absence are diplomats, artistic institutions, any kind of entertainment luminaries, and certainly nobody with any supernatural connections.

Arkin, posing as Sparkwright engineer Viktor, learns that the party is less of a soirée than the [Deckherd Hall incident]({% post_url /story/act-6/2023-11-16/2023-11-16-index %}) and more explicitly geared towards presentation. There are booths being prepared with different luxury goods, products from trade partners/vassals of the Empire, and experiential offers suggesting taste, class, and luxury . . . But those aren’t the central focus.

In fact, the central focus reveals itself to be a scaled-down version of one of those same mechanical heart devices, apparently rigged up on stage for a grand reveal. It’s got one line connected to one of the larger devices in the lower portions of the apartments, and is also spitting out paper with numbers and letters. The numbers tend to be in 3-letter codes. The numbers are generally decimalized (x.yz) and are positive or negative. The stream never stops.

This mechanical heart is going to be the central focus of the presentation, as well as, presumably, the proffered “new way of living”.   
For example, one row might look like:

SNB +1.54   
ECT -0.03
