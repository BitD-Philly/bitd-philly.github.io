You can link to other wiki pages like this:`[link text](link-target)`, where `link text` is the text that is written on the page and `link-target` is the name of the page you are linking to (e.g., `[Duskvol](duskvol)`, `[The Billhooks](billhooks)`).

If you are linking to a stub (character, location, faction, etc. without a page), link instead to the place the stub is located on its related landing page (e.g., `[Nat Marseilles](npcs#nat-marseilles)` or `[The Dimmer Sisters](npcs#the-dimmer-sisters)`). You can also use this format to link to subheaders on any wiki page (e.g., `[Scurlock Manor](six-towers#scurlock-manor)`).

# Citations
**Note:** _Do not cite the wiki as a primary source!_ Acceptable sources include blog posts (e.g., session recaps), messages from the BitD Philly Discord (#fluff_and_nonsense, roleplay threads), dates of gameplay, and private communications with the DM.
