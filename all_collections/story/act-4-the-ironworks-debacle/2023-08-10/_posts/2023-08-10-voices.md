Elsewhere, far away from Duskvol (but not so far as you’d think).

***”. . . Why aren’t they awake? Did they? . . .”***

The sound of a shush echoes against the stone.

***”. . . They’ve got this . . . They have to . . . Come on, you shapeshifting fuck . . .”***

In Duskvol itself, a thin golden presence winds its way through the alleys of Six Towers. It is beginning to flicker and fade more and more. It is lost. It is unaccustomed to cities, and this city is far beyond anything it once knew.

***”. . . A rat, a bat . . . Anything . . .”***

The golden presence diminishes with every second. Without a host to sustain it, and after the power it has expended, it will not last long . . .

**”HONK”**

Perhaps the Skovlan goose recognizes something in the presence; both wild creatures, once powerful, now lost. Perhaps it is simply demarcating its territory. Perhaps it is merely acknowledging a shiny thing.

Whatever the case, it is sufficient.

**”HO-“**

In the prison beneath the waves, a slender, exhausted fist is raised in triumph. Three spent voices find it within themselves to let out a triumphant yell.

And in Duskvol, the goose’s black eyes glow gold. Within it, the Horned One surveys their surroundings with fresh eyes.
