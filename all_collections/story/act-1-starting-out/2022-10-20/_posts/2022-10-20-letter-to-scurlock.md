Dear Scurlock:

> I find myself thinking of the old days lately. You know the ones I mean . . . the OLD days. I know you will not laugh at me to say so: breaking a world is far easier than running one, after all, and we did have such fun in the breaking, didn’t we?

> And yet, you are Scurlock now, and my own title has lost its menace long ago. “The Immortal Emperor” . . . What a bore he sounds, eh? The Immortal Emperor sits idly at dozens of state functions, or bruises his backside on a succession of thrones, or gives tedious commands that please nobody but the fools that see to them. Now, “the Cinder King”, THAT’S a man to know! Fire and waste, shattering champions and forces single-handed, sweeping the old away in a glorious explosion!

> And yet, here I sit at dozens of state functions, etc. Perhaps sometimes I inspect a military column and salute dozens of conscripts and officers more dead and boring than any ghoul I once raised. Ah, Scurlock, the Cinder King truly is dead, and the dreadful, dreary, dull Immortal Emperor sits in his place.

> But enough of my musings. I hear tell you have found our old friend Lugos again! Or, the most important part of him. I hope you’re able to use him in some intrigue or scheme of yours. Do set him loose on some feckless nobles for me. I imagine he’s been starved of terror and blood these centuries past.

> I know something of the scoundrels you employed to retrieve him, and it’s quite curious: through some chicanery in the ghost field, two of them seem to have had visions of you! One saw your ministrations to the wretched Miss Beasby (capital work, you absolute artist), and the other saw your work from the OLD days, before “Lord Scurlock” made his little rookery in Six Towers. I do not offer advice or issue commands on this, only a friendly warning. Keep an eye on this band of blades in the dark. I think they will prove interesting.*

With heartiest best-wishes,   
His Exalted Imperial Majesty blah blah etc etc
