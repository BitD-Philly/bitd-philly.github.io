Arkin stomps around the Nameless hideout, stapling flyers to the walls in various intervals. They read: 

> <u>Team Meeting</u>   
> This Friday   
Noon   
Attendance ***MANDATORY***   
Lunch will be provided

He then returns to his room and pulls out a half-shattered clockwork spider from an airtight jar. After a long moment’s hesitation, he speaks into a microphone on the device.

“Team meeting. Friday. Noon. Be there. Tell the Spider that there will be information shared that she wants to know.” 

Arkin stows the spider and slowly walks to the bathroom. He begins to scrub his hands to rid them of blood that is not there.
