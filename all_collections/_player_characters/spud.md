# Story
## Backstory

A former member of one of the horse tribes from Severos, he was exiled by his own people for starting too many fights and butting heads with the leadership, literally!

After that Spud spent a period wandering before being captured by a roaming mercenary company. They were sent to collect combatants for a nearby gladiatorial arena and Spud found himself very suited for that line of work. 

Being a man of fairly low intelligence, he blindly and gleefully partook in all manner of fights in the arena for many years and became its reigning champion. 
Eventually he became aware that the owners of the arena were profiting off the fights far more than the gladiators and Spud led a revolt and killed all his captors. 

After that he spent more time wandering aimlessly, looking for opportunities to make money or spill blood, until he ends up in Duskwallâ€¦ [^intro-post]
