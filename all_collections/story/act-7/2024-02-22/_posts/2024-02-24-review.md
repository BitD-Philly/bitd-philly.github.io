Maeve Deltzer, now moved into her Nightmarket suite, is positively vibrating with excitement as she types away. At least 40% of this is a hefty dosage of Spark, but the remaining 60% appears to be genuine excitement.

> DuskViolence II was a crowning achievement and triumphant return for the sleeping Void Sea Wrestling giant. Hosting by a returning Rock "The John" Dwayneson.

> **1. Handausen vs. Ventrue**    
> Curtain-jerker comedy-supernatural match introduced the crowd to old fan-favorites. Back and forth fifty-fifty booking with some spots played for laughs as Ventrue tries to bite Handausen and Handausen tries to curse Ventrue. Banana-skin win for the vampire. If we're treating the supernatural as a joke then this is the spot for the weirdos. Good luck telling the Pallbearer that. Match was proficient. **2.5 Stars.**

> **2. Exhibition: Red Sash Dance**   
> First showcase of V-Sea-W's more spectacle-based event choices. Music was bad. Unsure if bad because Iruvian music stinks or technical difficulties. Either way, I didn't come for sword and scarf ballet. **1 Star.**

> **3. Boss Bigman vs. Red Hot Dan Houston**   
> Return of two former V-Sea-W Champions giving it all they got. Mostly a brawl with very little technicality or any of the high-flying that's becoming popular. News backstage indicates a lot of Docks V-Sea-W workers backstage, including notorious Stein Scotter. Might be a sign of things to come. Either way, barricade spots and high-impact moves on the floor. Bigman without his iconic taser but plenty of plunder brawling. Sudden end with Bigman spearing the life out of Houston. Sloppy, but source backstage says Houston was mid-heart attack and the match was stopped to get him medical help. Wishing him a speedy recovery. Match was nostalgia without the bite that made the old stuff good. **2.5 Stars.**

> **4. Jammer vs. Ludo**    
> Second of V-Sea-Ws more spectacular milieu. If this is the direction they want to go I'm happy. Jammer, a new presence, cuts a promo dedicating the match to her partner and going on about the importance of them. Ludo, unconventional Hull character, comes down and cuts a promo for logic and against romance. Match ensues, with Ludo showing ingenious structure in a way that looks like a steel jellyfish. Jammer counters with two curved swords, shaped like a heart when she does her finishing move and disembowels Ludo. Fantastic weapon brawl with unconventional opponent, and good message. **Four Stars.**

> **5. Rodrigo vs. Eduardo vs. the Spider vs. Mousewing**   
> Incoherent but awe-inspiring. Rodrigo comes out first, athletic big man with bushy mustache. Cuts a vulgar promo about how someone named Eduardo fucked his mom. This brings out Eduardo, athletic big woman with a bushy mustache. Cuts a similarly vulgar promo about fucking his mom. The two lay into each other. Hard-hitting stuff. Plenty of technique but they were working real stiff. Awkward pause in the middle like someone missed their queue, then sudden off-stage leap as a fighter patterned on the Spider urban myth comes through. Rodrigo and Eduardo begin kicking the shit out of the Spider, but are distracted by debuting Hull fighter Mousewing. Mousewing gets torn up, but allows Spider to power up and take down Rodrigo and Eduardo. Incredibly precise work from the Spider, plus amazing gimmick additions to physique. Mousewing and Spider show of respect after match. I didn't understand the face-heel dynamics here but the fighting delivered and I'll let it play out. **Four Stars.**

> **6. Rock "The John" Dwayneson vs. The Shmeek**   
> Say what you will about John fatigue, but the Shmeek really delivered tonight. Off of his hosting duties, the John announced stiltedly that the Shmeek was challenging him. Pale twitchy kid comes out, nothing like the Shmeek we all remember. After break, John makes his entrance but Shmeek interrupts, full of fire and shrieking incoherently. That's the good stuff. Story of arrogant and cocky John thinking he could still hang while Shmeek's renewed raw power proved too much for him. Some skillful reversals by the John kept the match going fifty-fifty until the Shmeek appealed to the crowd for their approval and became supercharged. Ultimately, John forced to dig deep and outwrestle the Shmeek, renewing his bonafides as a wrestler. Surprise rollup gets the John the win. Shmeek is a made man off of this, even if signs point to the John being the face of the company going forward. Dynamics confused by a hijacking crowd but that's V-Sea-W. 4.5 Stars.

> **Backstage rumors:**   
> -Apparently Eduardo and Rodrigo match didn't go to plan. Awkwardness was because another performer was supposed to come out and play Rodrigo's daughter. No idea what happened, or who "the Spider" was. Seems like some hard pivots made.

> -The arrow through Red Hot Dan Houston's chest was not part of the match, and instead emergency medical aid. Houston is stable, but may need to be put to pasture.

> -Cactus Joe was approached for a spot in one of the matches, but is apparently retired for good.

> -The Pallbearer was not approached to be part of the show and is pissed. Says he is in contact with Rock Dwayneson and things are being worked out.

> -Rock Dwayneson will apparently be getting a big push going forward as the dominant champion, but will showcase more spectacle and unconventional fighters.

> -A bomb scare did not disrupt the event but was reported by Six Tower citizenry. Fireworks after the Dwayne's win were apparently controlled detonations.
