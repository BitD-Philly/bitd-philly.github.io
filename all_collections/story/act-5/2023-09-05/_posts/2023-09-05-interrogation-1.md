Studebaker Spud kneels on the floor of a darkened room, sweating profusely and contused along his bare back. An unseen figure paces about him, present only in the swish of fabric and the occasional welt they leave.

There is a sense that this could turn from punitive to kinky at the drop of a dime.

**"Again, Mr. Spud,"** intones the figure from the darkness, **"And do it right this time."**

*"Okay, now . . . Ain't no need f'r more scourgin' . . ." gasps Spud, hands raised conciliatorily, "It's like this, now . . . Ol' Spud hired out them Nameless folks for ta get rid o' that nightclub just like y' asked. Problem is, them Six Towers folk jes' wanted things at Strauss X7 (that's the nightclub, now) ta quiet down a little, on account o' the loud music. An' them Billhooks, well, they wanted a piece o' the club, and they's business 'ssociates with the Nameless now. So ol' Spud got outbid, ya see! Now the club's a joint Billhooks-Nameless ennerprise . . . But they's QUIET, now! Ain't that enough? Ain't no more hetâ€™rosessuality an' whatnot comin' outta there. Ain't that 'nough?"*

Something lashes from the darkness across Spud's back, and he yelps. The quality of the yelp leaves the dynamic of this interrogation ambiguous.

**"And why are the Billhooks involved with the Nameless AT ALL, Mr. Spud?"**

*"Ooooh, that's a whole 'nother story! See, them Nameless went on down to the Docks to resolve all a' the chicanery an' foot-dickin' 'round over the Lightning Wall. They was dealin' with the Bluecoats, the Ministry of Preservation, the Lampblacks, the Fog Hounds . . . and the Billhooks! All a' them was impedin' progress, now, and the Nameless was gonna set 'em right. SO, they faked a Lightnin' Wall failure ta scare 'em all straight, let the Bluecoats take the credit f'r handlin' it, hired the Fog Hounds on ta work as fences, an' got rid a' that boy Coran so's Erin could take over the Billhooks as sole leader! So NOW them Nameless done suborned the Foghounds, quid-pro-quo'd Capt'n Morgan Clelland o' the Bluecoats, scared them Lampblacks, an' got the Billhooks on-side so's the Lightning Wall'd get fixed!"*

Spud winces, expecting another lash. None is forthcoming.

**"And how does that make it so the Billhooks ended up financially entangled with the Nameless?"**

*"Well, so it's a tricky situation! See, Erin was Coran's aunt, now, and Coran's dad runs the Billhooks from prizon. Them two was tryin' ta jockey f'r leadership, but they couldn't move 'gainst each other cuz they's kin and they's got partisans in the Billhooks. Ain't want the gang to collapse under them, now. So Erin thinks, 'I want my nephew gone, but I don't want them as does it to have no blackmail on me'. So she says 'y'all do what y'all gonna do, but y'all gonna let me invest in Void Sea Wrestlin', so's I can tank your business if'n I need to. An' y'all's gonna let me put MY fightin' pits under V-Sea-Dub, so's we can make money off that brand recognition!'"*

**". . . I . . . see . . . And so, back to Strauss X7. The Nameless own the club, although it is under Billhooks management. How did they get the owner to part with it? We know enough about Puerto Rico Strauss to know he would not sell his only successful endeavor willingly."**

*"Okay, so follow me now . . . Puerto Rico Strauss had hisself a magic money bag. He thought he was prayin' t' his dead friend Hungry Steve an' that Hungry Steve was givin' him ghost money, but it was somethin' else . . .*
