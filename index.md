# Welcome, scoundrel!

This is the website for the Nameless, a gang of thieves and sneaks who prowl the streets of Duskvol by lamplight-- nabbing the valuables of the rich and powerful, fighting ghosts and automatons, and running such illicit ventures as the city's premier wrestling ring. All under the watchful eyes of the emperor and his servants.


Hopefully that means something to you, but if not, welcome to the world of Blades in the Dark! Blades in the Dark is a table top role playing game developed by John Harper. You can find more information in the Links page. Our gang plays biweekly and our games are run by GM Ted Gold.

The purpose of this website is to create a centralized place for the gang to be able to access important information quickly-- as a pocket reference to characters and other gangs, as well as keep track of some of the simulationist aspects of the game, as on the gang page.
