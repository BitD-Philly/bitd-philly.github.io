# Session Recap

-The infant Duskvol Palisade Avenue stock exchange was blown up and subsequently mashed through thanks to a superhuman Black Knight vs. half-possessed warlock vs. brick shithouse pit-fighter brawl (s/o Cruncho and Spud).

-The proposed gala celebrating its unveiling became a nightmare riot courtesy of our gang, the Shmeek, explosions, and shouting "fire" in a crowded room (tandem work from Arkin, Linmer, and Sandro).

-Sizzle has captured Joseph Woodward aka the Man in the Hat and (temporarily) severed him from the ghost field.

-The entire narrative has been spread to the newspapers courtesy of Sandro's media acumen: free market venture capitalism is a fraud, Seventh Tower are hucksters of the highest order, and law enforcement is investigating them (now headed up by Nat Marseilles).

-Chuck Morgenstern may be dead, or seriously injured

-Linmer has distilled and caused the capture of another Blighter iteration

-Y'all stole some fur coats from coat check.

-Bhed the Wolf "lives" in Cruncho's skeleton now.
