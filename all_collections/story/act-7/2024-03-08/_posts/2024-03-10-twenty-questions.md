title: Twenty Questions with Render
tag: fluff
---

This is an edited transcript of the minutes that robbed Lord Clelland of his skin and began the end of his life. We will not dwell on his arch denials, his sputtered indignation, his pleas for clemency, his agonized shrieks, nor the gurgling groans that he made when he escaped into insensate oblivion. 

We will also eschew description of Irag's instructions to his Crow assistants, as so accomplished a master deserves to keep the secrets of his trade (even from an omniscient narrator).

Thus, we are left only with the questions Render posed to the late Lord Clelland.

**Who initiated you into the worship of Vazara?**

**Who else worships Vazara with you?**

**Does your family possess Bartan lineage?**

<span style="font-size: 1.5em" markdown="1">**Have you made contact with other gods?**<span>

**Have you had any dealings with the Seventh Tower Consortium?**

**Have you had any dealings with 'the Spider'?**

**Have you had any dealings with the Nameless?**

**What do you know of demons? Do you know how to kill a demon on land?**

**What do you know of Breaker? What do you know of Setarra? What do you know of Minika Arya?**

**Do you know rage at the loss of the moon? Do you see shifting beasts beyond your window?**

**Does the presence of ghosts enrage you? Do you know the secret of consecrating your dead?**

<span style="font-size: 1.5em" markdown="1">**Does the name Zora mean anything to you?**</span>

**Do you plan to kill the Immortal Emperor?**

<span style="font-size: 1.5em" markdown="1">**Do you know the secret of killing the Immortal Emperor?**</span>

And then, quietly, when nailing Lord Clelland to his crucifix.

*"If . . . WHEN I kill the Immortal Emperor, will the gods grant me forgiveness?"*
