You can link to other wiki pages like this:`[link text](link-target)`, where `link text` is the text that is written on the page and `link-target` is the name of the page you are linking to.

* The [Seventh Tower Consortium](seventh-tower)

You can also link to sub-headers on any page by using a # after the `link-text`. For example, linking to Cruncho's backstory would look like this:

You can also add footnotes! [^example-citation]
