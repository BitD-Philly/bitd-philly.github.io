# Fickle Flames Fry Fortress, Foul Fighting Formulations!

> The GRAY CLOAK BASE OF OPERATIONS beneath their FORMER WATCH HOUSE has suffered a CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENTAL FIRE that NOBODY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH.

> Lost within the blaze were PLANS OF ATTACK AGAINST VOID SEA WRESTLING, evidence of BRIBERY AND BETRAYAL, information on AN UNNAMED GANG AND THEIR SECRET HIDEOUT, an upcoming RED SASH ALLIANCE, and plans for a WEB OF SNIPERS NESTS THROUGHOUT SIX TOWERS. Likewise slain within the inferno were AN UNMASKED MEMBER OF THE WRAITHS THIEVES GUILD, a VAMPIRE, and a STORE OF EXPLOSIVES. 

> Allegations that the Wraith was re-masked, saved from the vampire, and served as a negotiation point between the Wraiths and the Unnamed Thieves Guild for a BOOK OF LEVIATHAN ROUTES (possibly to serve as leverage against Lord Strangford) are correct but unconfirmed and unknown to all non-supernatural parties.

> Two DISGRACED ACADEMICIANS were surprised SCOUTING OUT THE BASE by returning GRAY CLOAKS (who had left their posts at the dark lure of THE DEADWINDS FIDDLER, commissioned specially from the CIRCLE OF FLAME). Potential fatalities were diffused when an experimental HEARTCALM BOMB sufficiently intoxicated all parties, such that they parted amicably. Reports at time of printing suggest that one academician has suffered a DRUG-INDUCED CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE.
