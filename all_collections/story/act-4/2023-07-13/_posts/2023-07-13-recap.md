- Young Hamwick, the demonic ragamuffin, is in possession of a safety deposit box belonging to “a bully”.
- Saltford’s stands on the site of an ancient fort called Skydagger Keep, where a legion of some kind once held out against something called The Cinder King. The legion was bolstered by someone called a Chosen of Vazara, and faced down undead forces captained by someone named Breaker and someone else named Blighter.
- A 9’ ghost wolf-man is free.
