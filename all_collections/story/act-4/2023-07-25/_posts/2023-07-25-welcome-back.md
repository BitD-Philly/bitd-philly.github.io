Casta the bounty hunter sits out on a Dockside rooftop, sipping gingerly on a flask of something. There's the sound of bedlam and chaos on the streets below, but this is unsurprising.

There's a fresh corpse lying next to her, but this is also unsurprising.

***"So . . . I think they know," she eventually sighs, seemingly to nobody.***

There's a bang, as a police crackdown escalates to gunfire (again, absolutely unsurprising).

***"Or, ya know, they suspect. Or somethin'. Kinda had to break cover a little."***

Screams below, and things begin to break in loud and spectacular fashion.

***"Yeah, I mean, you gettin' dropped off with th' Dimmer Sisters? Really fucked the dog on that. Hadta get yer Nameless on the job ta even get in. Sneak past some changelings, some Shadow Witches . . . Yer pet tinkerer killed a fuckin' Dimmer Sister, so that'll go over like fuckin' fireworks in dry grass. Oh, an' that Callus shit went an' beat the fuck out of some skinchangers. NEVER gonna hear the end of that, I bet."***

She pauses for a moment and takes another sip. When she speaks next, it's in a kind of conspiratorial whisper.

***"Mah fuckin' . . . y'know, GIRLfriend aced that asshole Mercy though. That was pretty sweet." ***
Another pause, punctuated by gunshots.

***"They still got Viktoria whatsherfuck down there, by the way. Ghost-mode. She covered for us when the Shadow Witches came lookin'. Could be an asset. Cram her inta Arkin an' ya got yerself a turducken of crazy science bullshit."***

She sighs and gets up, stretching out a little. Behind her, the corpse sits up abruptly. She turns around to see it, seemingly unbothered.

***"'eyyy . . . there's my guy."***

*"Indeed,"* replies Scurlock, rising in a single fluid motion. Behind the corpse's impoverished and gaunt aspect, his eyes glimmer with satisfaction, *"Here I am. Thrice and thrice and thrice again . . . here I am."*

***"What's the play, chief?"*** asks Casta, pocketing the hip flask.

Scurlock looks down, basking in the burning warehouse that is the result of peacekeeping Bluecoats.

*"Well, revenge, of course. Those idiotic cultists would be first in line for that. Lugos . . . he's a slave to Viktoria Karhowl's programming for now. I suppose decapitating him might be useful in the long run and cathartic in the short term . . . Yes, that would be best. But first . . ."*

He examines the corpse he's wearing, and a sneer forms on his borrowed face.

*". . . first, I think I need to change into something befitting my station."*
