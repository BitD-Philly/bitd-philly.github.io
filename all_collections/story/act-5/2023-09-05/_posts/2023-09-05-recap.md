The Nameless faked a lightning wall incident and made Captain Clelland and Erin of the Billhooks look like heroes of the hour WHILE ALSO doing an Inconvenient Truth. The Billhooks are financially embedded into the fabric of V-Sea-W and their civil war is over, with [Erin](/wiki/npcs#erin) as acting leader. [Coran](/wiki/npcs#coran) of the Billhooks has encountered Super Saiyan Goose and subsequently suffered ego death.

As a bonus, the Nameless struck up a financial relationship with the [Fog Hounds](/wiki/factions#foghounds) smugglers, and the [Lampblacks](/wiki/factions#lamplacks) are now under increased police scrutiny.

The Ironworks has been rebuilt with HEFTY controlling finance from the Ministry of Preservation.
