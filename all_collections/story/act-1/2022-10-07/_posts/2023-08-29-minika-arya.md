*The following is an interpretation offered by Linmer and Orianna.*

The story of Minika Arya (filtered through the libretto's lens, with the knowledge that you both now have) is tragic no matter how you look at it. The opera tells the story of a poor orphan who lost her parents in a shipwreck, guided wayward by the evil priests of an ancient and terrible goddess (Vazara) who is implicitly responsible for her orphanage. 

She is guided deeper into the priesthood until the culmination of her tragic arc, which involves her being hollowed out by Vazara to serve as her blasphemous Chosen. So possessed, she is forced to uphold the very pantheon that orphaned her. 

The opera ends with a literal and figurative Deus Ex Machina, in which a massive setpiece representing the Immortal Emperor (elsewise known as the Cinder King) begins to reclaim the world from these awful gods. Minika Arya is forced to ride into battle against him, but the Immortal Emperor shows her mercy and frees her from her possession. 

Newly empowered by the Emperor, Minika Arya ends the opera in a triumphant fashion, vowing to walk by his side and free all who have been used as poorly as she. Editorially, this belies the title "The Tragedy of Minika Arya", but there's some censorship codes in the Empire, which includes a directive that any story involving the Emperor's intervention cannot end tragically.

During the concluding scene, there is a long, seemingly shoehorned-in digression in which Minika Arya pulls out ensemble characters and declares them her aides and helpers, just as she is aide and helper to the Cinder King. One of the ensemble characters is "Elia, the Dreamwalker". Based on the text pattern and norms of propagandized fiction in the Empire, this digression was probably mandated by the Emperor's own historians.
