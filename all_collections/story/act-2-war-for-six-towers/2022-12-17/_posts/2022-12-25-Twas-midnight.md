'Twas midnight in Duskwall, and all through Six Towers  
A gang war was raging, all places and hours;  
The fight pits were roaring, the gamblers bet high,  
Hoping to cash out ere bullets start to fly;  
Void Sea Wrestling buzzed with joy and with coins,  
(A thing to make Lord Strangford hot in his loins);  
And Red Sashes passed through the crowd to and fro  
Making some side cash (which the owners don’t know)  
But, off in an alleyway, hidden and armed,  
Some Gray Cloaks are lurking, intent to do harm!  
They’re waiting for a moment best opportune  
To deal V-Sea-Dub a most grievous wound  
The cries of the wrestlers, the shouts of the fans  
Gave sonic cover to their dastardly plans  
When, suddenly issuing forth from a house  
Came sneaking and squeaking a robotic mouse!  
It crept to a Gray Cloak in weapons arrayed  
And to his bare flesh applied a mighty taze!  
This served as a signal to those hidden near  
And a voice cried commands, as the Grays blanched in fear:  
“Fire, Katya! Now, Arcade! Stab quick, Talitha!  
Edvard, throw the bomb! Call ghosts, Orianna!  
Cooper and Arcade, call the Gondoliers in!  
Adric, calm the crowd! Get your mouse, Arkin!”  
The bombs, how they blew! The blades, how they bit!  
The Gray Cloaks fought and bled and died and ate shit!  
Some survivors fought through their foe’s hidden ranks  
While their fellows fell to the ghosts and the shanks  
And as the last Gray Cloak fled into the streets  
As terror and horror gave wings to his feet  
He heard a last battle-cry into the night,  
“You want Six Towers, Gray Cloaks? Ready for a fight!”
