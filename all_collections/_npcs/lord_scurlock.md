# Appearance
Scurlock was a dark, handsome man of noble descent. 

# Background
It is unclear what role Scurlock played in the time of the calamity or when he became a vampire, but the scurlock family is said to have become part of Duskvol's early settlements hundreds of years ago. Their family manor still stands in [Six Towers](six_towers).

# In Duskvol

Eventually, Scurlock would leave his former body behind and posess the body of recently slain [Lord Strangford](lord-strangford), causing panic in the Nameless who had been involved in his murder. In this body he would continue to infiltrate high governance and direct the Nameless from the shadows. [^my-footnote]
