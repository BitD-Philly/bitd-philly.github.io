- Ironworks is a company with multiple stakeholders, not least of which are all seven houses on the city council and successful mercantile class members. The Ironworks stakeholders are managing repairs, but a lot of help is coming in from the Ministry of Preservation.
- Materials are a problem down at the Docks because the profusion of excess material being ordered and shipped over creates a lot of possibility for criminal/cop profit. Components are going for a LOT these days.
- Leviathan Hunters are built to literally grapple with demon whales. Not a lot of commercial or private watercraft can handle that.
