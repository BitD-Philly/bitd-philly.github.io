And now, another edition of ***THIS DUSKVOLIAN LIFE.***

To walk the halls of the Lord Harvo Limelock Finishing School is to have the senses assailed by legacy. Busts of illustrious alumni, portraits of headmasters past, and blazoned awards for academic excellence line the walls of the institution, presenting passing students with tangible reminders of their place within a long line of excellence oblige.

However, to those students in-the-know, a different sort of legacy is growing: the legacy of "the Shmeek".

"The Shmeek is fucking CRAZY," enthuses Cole A., an upcoming senior, "I once told him I'd pay him 5 scales to throw a chair at (Vice-Dean) Rowder, and the dude aced him from a second story window! He got detention for like a month over that. Shmeeky's a legend."

"The Shmeek" is the moniker of sophomore Jeremy P, a younger son of a noble household. The etymology of the name is mysterious, and no two stories about its origin seem to line up. However, less enigmatic is the meaning of the word: to know "the Shmeek" is to know violence.

"I hear it's Bloodneedle," confides a freshman student under condition of anonymity, "He gets Bloodneedle from some Red Sash he knows and injects, like, twenty times what you're supposed to. My brother said he saw him headbutt a Hull until it broke, but I think he was lying."

While local legends of hard, borderline-unhinged champions are common among the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Crow's Foot or Coalridge, it's unusual to find such a hero in the polished streets of Brightstone. But talk to the students of Harvo Limelock and you'll find a similar mix of awe and reverence for the Shmeek.
"Last weekend, some really shady guy came looking for me, some guy who owned a fight pit in Six Towers, or something?" Cole A. reminisces, "He said he needed someone to fight this real badass dude as a distraction while they did some business . . . Red Hot Dan Houston, I think was the guy? Anyway, Shmeeky took the dude on. THEN, my girlfriend's dad came up and paid them both to protect him from some kind of ambush or something, real gang shit. And the Shmeek fuckin' did it!"

While allegations of criminal activity are, of course, merely rumor and heresay, there is no denying that "the Shmeek" is known to Void Sea Wrestling legend Red Hot Dan Houston. The man himself (nursing a leg wound that looks almost like it was gained from a bear trap) will eagerly tell you: the Shmeek is going places.

"RED HOT DAN HOUSTON THOUGHT HE WAS COMING OUT THERE TO (allegedly) THROW SOME PUNCHES, DOWN SOME BEERS, AND TEACH THE KIDS A LESSON ABOUT DRUGS," hollers Houston as we sit in his V-Sea-W dressing room, "BUT RED HOT DAN HOUSTON HAD THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE AGAINST THE SHMEEK. AND WHEN LORD S--------- PAID US TO COVER HIS RETREAT FROM THE GRAY CLOAKS, RED HOT DAN HOUSTON SAW THE SHMEEK TAKE ON SOME REAL NASTY CUSTOMERS ALL ON HIS OWN. THE SHMEEK HAS RED HOT DAN HOUSTON'S RESPECT, AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE!"

What does the future hold for "the Shmeek"? Are the allegations that he, Red Hot Dan Houston, and an unnamed Whisper served as a three-person vanguard for the notorious Lord S--------- accurate? We'll find out more in the next chapter of "The Shmeek Shall Inherit The Earth", next week.
