-[Young Hamwick](/wiki/elia-wickham), the demonic ragamuffin, is in possession of a safety deposit box belonging to “a bully”.
-Saltford’s stands on the site of an ancient fort called Skydagger Keep, where a legion of some kind once held out against something called [The Cinder King](/wiki/npcs#the-immortal-emperor). The legion was bolstered by someone called a Chosen of [Vazara](/wiki/npcs#vazara), and faced down undead forces captained by someone named [Breaker](/wiki/npcs#breaker) and someone else named [Blighter](/wiki/npcs#blighter).
