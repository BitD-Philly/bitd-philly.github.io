The gang is going to disrupt the [Billhook](/wiki/billhooks) weapons and money drops from [Seventh Tower](/wiki/seventh-tower) to make their involvement with the war feel too costly and dangerous.

The gang is bringing the [Horned One](/wiki/npcs#the-horned-one) and the [Fog Hounds](/wiki/factions#fog-hounds) in to disrupt Unity Day as the caravans are rerouted into [Brightstone](/wiki/brightstone)

Unity Day has only existed for the past 3 years, and has up until recently been a celebration of the Imperial victory over Skovland. HOWEVER, recently, there’s been a push to recontextualize the holiday to be a celebration of the BROADER IDEA of Unity and Togetherness..

And thanks to [Orianna](/wiki/affect), [Sizzle](/wiki/sizzle), and [Cruncho](/wiki/cruncho), this celebration would not be complete without the traditional Unity Door (a door given to The Troops by grateful Skovlanders).

DUSKVOL LOVES THE TROOPS

Cruncho is possessed by [Blighter](/wiki/npcs#blighter)   
The Horned One is on the same page as Orianna   
[Casta](/wiki/npcs#casta)’s called in her favor with Sizzle: throw the Black Knights and Render off the trail of the real killers of [Breaker](/wiki/npcs#setarra)   
[Render](/wiki/npcs#render) is coming soon   

The grad students were caught with illegal weapons and a couple go to jail
