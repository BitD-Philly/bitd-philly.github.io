Ambitious casino dealer and vice purveyor to the people of Duskvol.

# Appearance

A thin, angular looking individual, they generally hide any tell tale signs of their Tycherosian heritage through an assortment of thick white face makeup and multiple accessories. Impeccably well kept white suit; black silk shirt; leather shoes and driving gloves; visible skin painted white with makeup; pince-nez glasses with black tinted lenses.

# Story
## Backstory

Having arrived on board a small Tycherosian shipping vessel, Callus stayed behind to see how the people on this shattered continent chose to live - and how to profit off of them. Wandering the districts and populace, they found enjoyment in the emotional openness that many people in the city engaged with throughout their day to day lives. Especially in the Silkshore district, as purveyors of nearly every vice swarmed the area like vultures having found their next meal. He craved to hold to those emotional strings, to feed off of those perverse, violent, and hungry thoughts of the people in town, as well as his own.

Callus eventually found work as a card dealer in the Silver Stag Casino, one of many dens of inequity he perused as he spent the last of his old work's savings. At the encouragement of their bosses, they regularly engaged in collections work and other jobs requiring intimidating muscle on the side (both legal and illicit), garnering them a reputation as someone not to be dismissed. Enthusiasm in both avenues of work led to eventual promotion within the Casino's hierarchy for the young Tycherosian, but ambition has led Callus to look for more enjoyable - and profitable - contacts to work with.
