The good steamship *Winslow* bobs in the Void Sea off the Lost District. From a distance, with the right magnification, the occasionally skittering silhouette of a plague-masked Crow can be seen scuttling across the deck.

From a wrecked rooftop within the Lost District, Mikh and Sam sit on a picnic blanket and watch. 

(The ghosts don’t trouble them, for they know better)

***”Shame they didn’t actually have a way to contain the Crows,”*** remarks Sam as she munches on a dried mushroom, ***”That fighting league sounded kinda kickass.”***

**”Eh, I dunno. They ain’t exactly spectacle fighters. How many times can ya watch a Crow pull a liver outta someone before it stops bein’ special?”**

***”Well, we’ve watched ‘em work for centuries. Don’t think we’re the target audience.”***

**”Huh! Yeah. Good point. Ah well . . .”**

From their observation blind at a Docks tenement, Nat and Chuck squint out with binoculars.

*”You thinking what I’m thinking, Nat?”*

**”Wellllll . . . Crazy scheme to fight something dangerous, vehicular theft, lotta talking shit . . . It MIGHT not be her, but-“**

*”Nat . . . Come on. It’s her.”*

**”. . . Yeah. Shit.”**

The two pause and look at each other warily. After a moment, Nat extends her pinky towards Chuck.

**”Accountability, right? Neither one of us tries to get back with her.”**

Chuck extends his pinky and wraps it around Nat’s.

*”Totally! We’ve grown!”*

**”MATURED, even!”**

*”We don’t need her!”*

**”Damn right we don’t! Look at us, being mature about this!”**

(Both are, at this very moment, plotting how to get back with their mutual ex).

From a rooftop in Brightstone, the Spider watches.

***”Hrrrn . . .”***

She pulls out a small glowing device and speaks into it.

***”Crows possess some kind of partial intangibility. Able to traverse the Void Sea on foot. Omnimorphic physiology. Will need a sample . . .”***

She considers the scene before her a bit longer, and then finishes:

***”Assessment of subject, alias ‘Mara’, remains inconclusive.”***

<hr width="50%">

From a warehouse at the Docks, the Horned One watches. An idea begins to take root in its mind as it contemplates the loose ship.

<hr width="50%">

From the derelict Claddage manor, Scurlock shakes his head in wonder.

**”I will live an eternity and never fully understand them,”** he remarks to his companion, **”But I suppose that’s part of the- are you all right?”**

Next to him, Casta has gone sheet white, and then begins to flush. The telescope nearly drops from her hand.

*” . . Uh, yeah. Thought I saw my . . . Fuck.”*

Scurlock notes the sudden rush of emotion to his bodyguard’s face and decides to say nothing.

<hr width="50%">

Beneath the surface of Duskwall, the temple of the Dimmer Sisters is awash with light. An orb shows the Winslow and its gruesome cargo.

Boris Volkov harrumphs after a few moments of looking.

**”Fuck me, I think I know that guy . . .”**

<hr width="50%">

Stein Scotter stares longingly at the Winslow. He doesn’t know why, but the words of a fan after a bar fight have lit something inside him. The fight pits are burdens now, jobs instead of joys. There is no further violent delight to be found in the land-locked squared circles of the V-Sea-W.

Perhaps . . . Perhaps he SHOULD give Crow Combat Cruises a shot . . .
