*The woman in a darkened room sits before her desk, a blank piece of parchment in front of her. There is also a shot glass of whiskey, which she knocks back with unseemly haste.*

***"Another,"*** she rasps, gesturing.

*Soundlessly, Lord Scurlock emerges from the shadows and pours her another shot. Dark veins shoot through his pallid flesh, and his hand has the slightest tremor.*

*The woman knocks back another shot. The process repeats four more times before she stops calling for more drink. Scurlock hovers behind her, seemingly unperturbed but still shaking mildly. The woman throws him a look of contempt*.

***"Ache . . . You lose Ache, of all of them to lose . . ."***

*She stares at the parchment, picks up her quill, swears a string of profanity, and begins to write.*
