> 'Twas the night of Unity Day, and across Duskwall   
Two forces were plotting the Nameless' fall  

> To one side, the Billhooks, their fellowship strained,   
Had for themselves a celebration arranged   
A sitdown they'd called for, a summit in fact!

Their patrols diminish'd, they've closed their fight pits   
And to this reunion they pledge 2d6   

> Elsewhere in Six Towers, the Seventh doth plot   
And prepare to reverse all the losses they've got   
They toil away in their tenements gutted   
And make of them condos with luxuries studded

And to this project they'll pledge d6 of 3
