*This formerly prestigious district has faded over the centuries into a pale shadow of what it once was. The eponymous six towers were originally the grand residences of Doskvol’s first noble families. All but two (Bowmore House and Rowan House) have been sold of and converted into cheap apartments or fallen into ruin and abandoned. The district has an empty, haunted feel, with many sprawling old buildings dark without power, broad stone streets cracked and buckled, and the fires of squatters crackling from overgrown lots.*

The delapidated district is noentheless the relatively undisputed territory of the Nameless, who lurk in the shadows of its spires. 

# Notable Locations 
* Arms of the Weeping Lady -- This grand building, formerly an opera house, is now a soup-kitchen and bunkhouse for the destitute, run by the charity of the Weeping Lady. Locals use this landmark as the demarcation between the districts of Charterhall and Six Towers. 
* Deckherd Hall -- Headquarters of the [Seventh Tower Consortium](../organizations/seventh-tower)
* The Nameless' Lairs -- The various resting places of the Nameless, scattered across many of the neighborhood's derelict manors.
* Mistshore Park -- This dark and overgrown space overlooks the eastern branch of the river Dosk and the deathlands beyond. In old folk ballads, young lovers who could not be together would commit suicide in this park. Whatever the truth of it, the park is certainly haunted now.
* Rowan House -- One of the last of the original six towers, this antique building resembles an ancient castle from history books, complete with moat, draw-bridge, and arrow-slit windows. The powerful Rowan family rules their holdings from within the fortress, rarely venturing beyond the security of its thick stone walls.
* Scurlock Manor -- The ancestral home of one [Lord Scurlock](../characters/scurlock). Currently a derelict and haunted place. The Scurlock family came to Duskwall centuries ago and was once a great force in the city, before some curse or calamity befell their line. This tumble-down manor house and tangle of vines is all that remains of their original fortune. It’s said that a young nephew or cousin still resides there, but Lord Scurlock himself has moved on to finer abodes.
* Void Sea Wrestling Arena -- Originally a large spa with a pool, it has been converted into an outdoor wrestling arena. Replete with an attached gambling den with two stories. Flanked by watchtowers that double as changing rooms.
